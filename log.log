<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/titus-welliver-as-harry-bosch-in-freevee-s-bosch-legacy-holding-a-flashlight.jpg?id=31860744&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C36%2C0%2C371"/><br/><br/><p>Amazon’s streaming efforts have long been all about Prime Video. So the company caught pundits by surprise when, in early 2019, it launched a stand-alone ad-supported streaming service called IMDb Freedive, with Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/amazons-imdb-launches-a-free-streaming-service-freedive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the move</a> “a bit odd.”</p><p>Nearly four years and two rebrandings later, Amazon’s ad-supported video efforts appear to be flourishing. Viewership of the service <a href="https://videoweek.com/2021/09/23/imdb-tv-is-quietly-becoming-an-avod-juggernaut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew by 138%</a> from 2020 to 2021, according to Amazon. The company declined to share any updated performance data on the service, which is now called Freevee, but a spokesperson told Protocol the performance of originals in particular “exceeded expectations,” leading Amazon to increase investments into original content by 70% year-over-year.</p><p>Key to Freevee’s success has been its deep integration with Prime Video and Fire TV, where it lives alongside ad-free subscription fare, pay-as-you-go rentals, and third-party subscription channels. Now Amazon is looking to broaden its international reach.</p><p>“I'm very excited about the possibility of an ad-supported service in front of the paywall in many countries,” said Ryan Pirozzi, who has been working on Amazon’s video strategy for over a decade and became head of Freevee in August.</p><h3>IMDb TV was not standing out</h3><p>When Amazon first launched its free video service, it was looking to capitalize on the IMDb brand it has owned since 1998. “Our early thinking was, people recognize that brand,” said Pirozzi. However, the branding didn’t exactly catch on with consumers, in part because IMDb was best known as a database for industry professionals. </p><p>Changing the service’s name to IMDb TV did little to solve those issues, which is why the company ultimately switched to the Freevee brand in April of this year. “IMDb TV wasn’t standing out as much as Freevee is,” Pirozzi said. “Personally, I’m very happy we rebranded.”</p><p>Third-party data suggests the rebrand is working: The service’s mobile apps generated about as many downloads since the rebrand as it did during the years preceding it, according to estimates by app intelligence company Sensor Tower. For the five months following the rebrand, downloads were up 113% compared to the preceding five months.</p><p>The total number of installs of the Freevee mobile app is still fairly small, with Sensor Tower estimating the app  has been downloaded 3.3 million times from Google Play and the App Store, while Google’s own data puts the number of downloads from Google Play between 5 and 10 million.</p><p>The service is closely integrated with Prime Video, where its movies and shows are being presented as “free with ads.” Mixing subscription-exclusive content with free, ad-supported videos <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/smart-tvs-content-first" target="_self">can be confusing to consumers</a>, but Pirozzi argued that it was a trade-off for being able to offer more choices, which also includes access to pay-as-you-go movie rentals. </p><p>“We have to work on eliminating any confusion,” he said, adding that Freevee was growing both as a stand-alone service and within Prime Video. “I think people are getting it. Our best SVOD customers are our best TVOD customers [and are also] our most engaged AVOD customers.”<br/></p><h3>Uncertain times for streaming</h3><p>The ascent of Freevee happens as the entire streaming industry is rediscovering free, ad-supported video. Fox has plans to turn its free Tubi streaming service into a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/tubi-will-become-a-billion-dollar-business-foxs-lachlan-murdoch-says" target="_blank">billion-dollar business</a>; Viacom’s Pluto TV reached that same milestone <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>. Even Netflix, which long resisted advertising, is <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-microsoft-ads-partners" target="_self">getting ready to launch an ad-supported tier</a>. </p><p>At the same time, there are some signs that parts of the industry are slowing their investments into originals in light of a more challenging economic climate. Warner Bros. Discovery, for instance, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-strategy?rebelltitem=1" target="_self">canceled several projects for HBO Max recently</a>. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9">

</p><p>“I guess I must have missed the memo,” Pirozzi retorted, pointing to the fact that Freevee’s investments into originals have increased by 70%. Some of the originals running in the service include “Bosch: Legacy,” a spin-off of the police procedural “Bosch” that ran on Prime Video for seven seasons; “Judy Justice,” a remake of “Judge Judy”; and ex-con comedy “Sprung.”</p><p>These shows may not pay for themselves, but they do work to attract new audiences. “Originals and pay-window movies are a customer acquisition driver,” Pirozzi said. “Then we drive depth of engagement with licensed content, deeper catalog, and linear channels. That model has been working for us, and we see big uplifts in our business when we launch something like a ‘Bosch: Legacy.’”</p><p>Many of these originals are also being repurposed for linear free ad-supported streaming channels, also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/plex-live-tv-linear-streaming" target="_self">known as FAST channels among industry insiders</a>. “This rise of FAST linear channels is so fascinating,” Pirozzi said. “To some people, it’s sort of retro. It’s in a linear format without pause or fast forward. But that’s really growing and working for us.”</p><p>Freevee’s more than 100 free linear channels are closely integrated with Amazon’s Fire TV platform, where they are presented as part of the live TV tab. The linear format also allows Amazon to carry some content that it would otherwise not have the rights to, Pirozzi explained. “‘Kim’s Convenience,’ one of my favorite shows on Netflix, is not available to license on demand,” he said. However, Amazon was able to license the show as a linear channel, which it now streams to Freevee viewers.<br/>Freevee debuted in Germany in August after expanding to the U.K. last year. Now, the service is looking to jump into new territories.</p><p>“We have greater international expansion plans,” Pirozzi said. He declined to share Amazon’s exact road map, but suggested that there may be opportunities in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Asia, among others.<br/></p><p>“There are so many places where the value proposition of an ad-supported video product will be very popular with customers,” he said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Biden’s AI Bill of Rights shoots for the stars.

Today we look at the AI Bill of Rights from the White House and how it fits into the existing privacy push by Congress. As you have likely already heard, the Twitter deal is back on. Also, Micron plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in a New York state chip factory thanks to the Chips-Plus package.</em></p><h3>Pie in the sk(AI)</h3><br/><p>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday unveiled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. The document is lofty and well intended, but not particularly practical in the near term — nor to the liking of some AI watchdogs, as Protocol’s Kate Kaye <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights" target="_self">pointed out</a>.</p><ul><li>The white paper sketches out five standards that will help ensure automated systems don’t infringe on our rights: protection from unsafe systems, equitable/nondiscriminatory algorithms, agency over our data, transparency over automated systems, and access to opt-outs and remedies. </li><li>(Sorry, if you were expecting a <a href="https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1577367260510924802?s=20&t=QfFlXeQ5cbsQuosM0y4wog" target="_blank">manifesto on the rights of sentient robots</a>, look elsewhere.) </li></ul><p><strong>The OSTP is careful to emphasize that it’s only intended to support the development of official policies.</strong> In other words, the AI Bill of Rights has as much legal authority as this newsletter. Still, it’s useful in that it represents a sort of regulatory wish list for the Biden administration. </p><ul><li>To be fair, the OSTP includes a lot of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-enterprise/white-house-ai-samsung-chips?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">precise, prescriptive guidance</a> for corporations. The infeasibility doesn’t come from the lack of specific guidance, then, but from the fact that corporations are unlikely to respond unless compelled by the government. </li><li>Some of the guidance is also so disruptive to the status quo that it would remake entire industries. For example, the AI Bill of Rights advises that “you should be able to opt out from automated systems in favor of a human alternative.” But there simply <em>aren’t</em> human alternatives at scale for much of what we do on the internet.</li></ul><p><strong>Sometimes the OSTP doesn’t even seem sure of its own recommendations.</strong> For example, the bill of rights calls for unchecked surveillance to be avoided unless “strictly necessary” but then goes on to say national security agencies should only abide by these guidelines “where feasible.” So, you know … restaurants should never charge extra for guac, but Chipotle can do so “when convenient.” </p><p><strong>These feasibility challenges persist in the prescriptions for the private sector.</strong> </p><ul><li>The OSTP calls for the timely removal of user data from machine learning systems trained with that data. But as I’ve <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/pipelines-data-privacy-design" target="_self">noted before</a>, companies often have no idea where user data flows within their own data pipelines. This complexity likely makes it impossible to comply with existing privacy laws, including the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a>. </li><li>The OSTP also tells companies they should be doing “proactive equity assessments” while also not tracking or using proxies for demographic features. How do you verify lack of bias against a demographic while also ensuring you can’t track it? </li></ul><p><strong>The bill of rights goes above and beyond the primary federal bill under consideration — and that may be its greatest strength. </strong>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text#H88DA5D95E892448B9DDA6F37E0106E77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a> is a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/privacy-draft-2022" target="_self">big deal</a>, even if it suffers from a significant <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/privacy-preemption-adppa?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">preemption problem</a>. But next to the AI Bill of Rights, it looks somewhat unambitious: </p><ul><li>There’s overlap in the sense that both the ADPPA and the AI Bill of Rights say Americans should be able to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/federal-privacy-law-introduced?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">request</a> their information, request that it be deleted, and tell companies to change personal information when it’s not accurate.</li><li>But the bill of rights <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/#privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes</a> many more ambitious privacy goals, including more rigorous consent standards for obtaining user data and better data protections in sensitive user domains such as health care and education. </li><li>The ambiguity and idealism in the AI Bill of Rights can be criticized as its greatest weakness, but in some sense they are its greatest strength: The document shows the federal government is at least thinking of privacy in a much more ambitious way than the bills in Congress would let on. </li></ul><p>The OSTP shot for the stars. Congress is still on the ground building a privacy foundation. That combination in itself can be a great thing. But if ADPPA ends up not passing, what use do we have for a starry-eyed bill of rights? </p><em>— Hirsh Chitkara (</em><a href="mailto:hchitkara@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/hirshchitkara" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em><h3>In Washington</h3><br/><p><strong>The Twitter <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">deal</a></strong><strong> is back on … probably.</strong> Elon Musk on Tuesday sent a letter to Twitter saying he’d buy the company at his original offered price of $54.20 per share.

One area that’s being built out is crypto trading as a service, with APIs and other products that developers and companies can use to set up crypto trading for their clients. </p><p>The latest sign of this maturation is EDX Markets, a new exchange for digital assets that’s being developed by Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab, as well as venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm.</p><p>The digital exchange, headed by former Citadel Securities executive Jamil Nazarali, is roughly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-and-others-start-crypto-exchange-edx-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeled</a> on and built on the trading technology of Members Exchange, or MEMX, another exchange that’s being developed by similar companies as an alternative to large stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq.</p><p>EDXM’s custody and wallet technology is being provided by crypto custody and infrastructure company Paxos, the companies announced Wednesday</p><p>Paxos, which is a custodian regulated by New York state, holds customer accounts in fully segregated accounts and has signed up large consumer-facing clients to enable crypto trading. Its customers include PayPal, broker dealers such as Interactive Brokers, and others such as Nubank and Mastercard. Paxos has a conditional bank trust charter from the <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCC</a> and says it expects its chartered entity, Paxos National Trust, to open later this quarter.</p><p>Up until now big banks haven’t moved heavily into crypto because of accounting, risk, security, and regulatory concerns, as well as requirements by the Federal Reserve and a desire for more mature technology, said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “We still haven't seen any of the big bank holding companies in the U.S. bring one of these offerings to market,” he added.</p><p>EDXM, with its leadership and backing from Wall Street firms, could attract large banks into digital assets, he said. EDXM is “bringing traditional market structure and also traditional market participants to this liquidity offering through the exchange that is going to be really built to support and attract these types of bank holding companies and brokerages,” Hessert said. For example, EDXM plans to offer delivery settlement versus payment <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/172104/edx-markets-ceo-vows-to-learn-from-travails-at-rival-institutional-crypto-exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settlement</a>, a settlement method that’s used in traditional securities trading. </p><p>EDXM is also different from some other crypto providers that are the market maker, exchange, and custodian all in one, which can be a conflict of interest and is typically not done in traditional markets, Hessert said.</p><p>More large liquidity pools such as EDXM will also increase transparency for the crypto market, Hessert said. Presently, crypto markets can be opaque, with large spreads and high volatility.</p><p>The competition to provide crypto trading, custody, security, and related technology for large institutions is intense. The resulting consolidation wave isn’t without some hiccups: Wyre canceled its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/bolt-axes-15b-deal-to-buy-crypto-infrastructure-provider-wyre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal</a> to be acquired by Bolt for $1.5 billion last month. But more deals could soon come in this sector, since numerous providers offer overlapping services, analysts say. </p><p>Coinbase provides crypto trading APIs, custody, payments API, and related services, seeking to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/coinbase-cloud-node" target="_self">lure big and small</a> customers alike. Coinbase has three related APIs — a general-purpose one for trading, deposits, withdrawals, and tax reporting; another for streaming market data; and a specialized FIX API for sophisticated traders.

Too bad. https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/apple-app-store-price-hike Wed, 05 Oct 2022 11:15:09 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/apple-s-planned-price-hike-is-going-into-effect.png?id=31864079&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><strong>Good morning! </strong>Apple hiked App Store prices by around 20% in some markets outside the U.S. without any explanation and with barely any notice. Critics are unsurprisingly upset, but what choice do they have?</p><h3>It’s Apple’s party, and it’ll charge if it wants to</h3><br/><p>The App Store just became a little pricier for many non-U.S. customers. Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e1b1hcmv&1663640181" target="_blank">planned price hike</a> went into effect today for any market that uses the euro, in addition to Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In most markets, the price increase equates to about 20% higher costs for apps (though it’s even more in some countries, like Japan and South Korea). So a mobile app that was previously 0.99 euros now costs 1.19 euros, while the same is true for an in-app purchase like mobile game currency. Curiously, Apple isn’t saying why exactly, leaving developers to guess whether it’s due to currency fluctuations, the related global economic crisis, or perhaps rising energy costs related to operating the App Store overseas. </p>
<p><strong>The price hike is arriving at a sensitive time. </strong>The combination of record inflation and a looming global recession has started to take a serious toll on foreign markets as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/16/business/strong-dollar.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strength of the U.S. dollar continues to grow</a> relative to weakening foreign currencies like the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. </p><ul><li>While Apple has yet to raise prices in the U.S., it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/apple-raises-iphone-14-price-in-uk-japan-australia-overseas-markets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiked the price</a> of the new iPhone 14 lineup in Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K., in some cases by the equivalent of nearly $150. </li><li>A number of other consumer electronics companies, including PlayStation maker Sony, have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enacted similar hardware price hikes</a> in the EU and other markets in recent months. </li><li>Apple can certainly afford to weather any economic storms better than most, if not all, of its competitors. In its last earnings announcement from July, Apple said it had a record Q3 with $19.6 billion in services revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. </li><li>The company remains the most valuable in the world with a market cap of more than $2.3 trillion. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple critics are not pleased. </strong>Naturally, a price hike with little explanation and on such short notice is going to rankle Apple's usual detractors in the developer community, including Fortnite maker Epic Games. But the criticisms have grown especially pointed given the current economic climate. </p><ul><li>“These increases were made without the input or consent of app developers, which highlights the extent of Apple’s market power. In no other industry can a business single-handedly increase the prices of another business’s products,” <a href="https://appfairness.org/coalition-for-app-fairness-blog-on-apple-price-increases/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Rick VanMeter, the executive director for the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness, of which Epic, Match Group, and Spotify are members. </li><li>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had harsh words, too. “Imagine if a landlord told their small business tenant they had to increase their prices without any say in the matter or anywhere else to go,” he said in a statement yesterday. “That is what Apple is doing to developers for no other reason than to pad Apple’s bottom line.”</li><li>“Developers don't want to raise their app prices in the EU and UK. Consumers don't want app price increases in the EU and UK. Central banks fighting inflation don't want app price inflation,” Sweeney wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1577032444955746304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">follow-up tweet yesterday</a>. “But Apple is raising developers' prices against developers' wishes.” </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple is no stranger to sudden price increases. </strong>For decades, the iPhone maker has exercised near-total control of its software ecosystems, including the digital storefronts it has operated since the days of iTunes. </p>
<ul><li>You might remember when Apple infamously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/apple-begins-variable-pricing-on-itunes-store-some-songs-now-129-each/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the price</a> of newer, more popular MP3s on the iTunes Store from 99 cents to $1.29. The move, a concession to the music industry, helped <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/09/itunes_price_increases_mean_slower_sales_for_music_labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labels sell more albums</a> after years of complaints that the era of iTunes pushed consumers toward buying singles over albums. There was plenty of hand-wringing at the time, but nothing really changed. That is, until music streaming took off and individual song sales began to decline. </li></ul>
<p>But there is no comparable distribution change for mobile apps or the App Store on the horizon. Apple sets the rules for commerce on iOS, and everyone must follow — so long as they want to reach iPhone customers.<br/><br/><em>— Nick Statt</em><br/></p><h3>The Twitter drama has only just begun</h3><br><p>Elon Musk decided, seemingly out of nowhere, that he actually <em>will</em> buy Twitter. But before you assume the roller coaster ride is over, think again.</p>
<p><strong>Musk <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">sent a letter</a> to Twitter </strong>proposing to buy the company at the original, agreed-upon price of $54.20 a share provided the company agrees to forget the whole court battle. Twitter shares jumped on the news before exchanges halted trading.</p>
<ul><li>The news coincidentally broke at the same time Twitter employees were entering a long meeting about its 2023 strategy. Very funny, we know.</li><li>Twitter said it received Musk’s letter and intends to close the deal at the original price. It hasn’t addressed Musk’s proposal to end its lawsuit.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk and Twitter could be entering even muddier waters, </strong>where the company will transition to a whole new owner who has expressed rather controversial ideas about the service. What happens next could go like this, as described by Protocol Policy editor Kate Cox:</p><ul><li>Step one: Musk buys Twitter!</li><li>Step two: ???</li><li>Step three: Twitter reaches profitability under Musk.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk loves to prove the skeptics wrong, </strong>and turning Twitter around could be another way to do it. But those question marks are there for a reason: the details of how he would do it are beyond murky. </p><ul><li>How will Twitter employees — the ones who haven’t fled the company in droves as the acquisition moil unfolded, that is — react? </li><li>How will he handle the spam problem he cited as an excuse to walk away from the deal?</li><li>Musk offered one cryptic hint about his plans in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>: “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-elon-musk-buys-his-old-x-com-domain-from-paypal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reclaimed</a> the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, and has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1557199404301307904" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teased</a> the idea of building a Twitter competitor on it.</li></ul>There are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/twitter-lbo-revives-12-5-billion-headache-for-wall-street-banks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questions about the debt financing</a> needed to close the deal, and Musk and Twitter will have to thrash out what to do about the pending lawsuit. But if they can overcome those obstacles, Twitter will get a new owner and a different future. The one true thing we can say about both: They are completely unpredictable.<br/><br/><p><em>— Sarah Roach</em></p><h3>​The calm before the storm</h3><br><p>Hundreds of companies that cut staff in recent months announced major funding rounds just a few months before. But startups aren’t blowing through their funding weeks after the check is deposited; it’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/layoffs-funding-data" target="_self">more complicated than that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Startups often wait several months to a year </strong>after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public about it.</p><ul><li>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners, told Nat. </li><li>This is because founders often want to announce funding with other big news, like a product release or an executive hire. </li></ul>
<p><strong>The bigger an organization gets, </strong>the more secretive it becomes about funding updates. News of a big check is easier to keep from leaking publicly at a company of 100 compared to a company of 2,000, Alban said. </p><ul><li>Companies like Bolt, Getir, and Trade Republic caught flack for this very reason. Many employees said they felt betrayed, as funding announcements gave the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. </li><li>“Bolt employees were blind sided because the CEO was saying just weeks ago how everything is fine,” <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Bolt-just-layed-off-people-in-the-worst-way-possible-yL7QauTE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an anonymous user wrote on the message board Blind</a>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>To help ease the blow of layoffs, </strong>being transparent can go a long way. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Anthony Kline, a partner at VC firm The GP.<br/><br/><em>— Nat Rubio-Licht</em><br/></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM CAPITAL ONE SOFTWARE</h3><br><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="0b87547b908f01341fe8a968efb24080" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123932305&iu=/21901267728" id="b689f" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843120&width=980"/></a>Many business leaders aren’t sure where to begin when it comes to migrating to the cloud.

The legislation allowed some families to <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/taxact/file-for-less-and-get-more/understanding-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly double</a> their tax benefits per child, which was especially critical for low-income families, who disproportionately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/04/20/covid-19-pandemic-pinches-finances-of-americas-lower-and-middle-income-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bore the financial brunt</a> of the pandemic. </p><p>For Amanda Renteria, the <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/safety-net-innovation-lab-audacious-ted-talk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEO of Code for America</a>, the new legislation meant the work had only just begun. Renteria understood that making tax credits available is one thing, but helping families navigate bureaucracy to get them is another. Renteria also knew that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a nonprofit that helps the government use technology to better serve communities, could play a critical role in addressing that access problem. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Renteria explained how she made the decision to develop a proof of concept for an app that would help people claim the Child Tax Credit. Code for America developed this mock-up despite limited resources and no guarantee that it would be selected by the government as its technology partner. The leap of faith ended up paying off, and Code for America reported in May that it <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/code-for-america-getctc-portal-returns-for-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped</a> 115,000 families successfully claim the tax benefit throughout the 2021 tax filing season. </p><p><em>Renteria’s story, as told to Protocol, has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What we knew about the IRS, having worked with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program [last year], is just how hard it is for people to get through [the system to get benefits].</strong> With VITA, we helped create an online, mobile-friendly, simplified application that actually walks you through [the process] in both English and Spanish. </p><p><strong>When Child Tax Credit came up, we knew that this policy — though it passed and everyone was excited about it — would actually hit a wall. </strong>We had seen the barriers over time on much easier processes, like food assistance in some states. </p><p><strong>We knew filling out forms is extremely difficult.</strong> So there wasn't even a question of whether or not we could make this process better. Again, [this was] largely because we had been doing it for a while. We helped VITA sites go online the year before, and we could actually see how you improve throughput if you have a simplified process.</p><p><strong>The big question for us was whether we wanted to build it, knowing we weren't sure whether it would land. </strong>A lot of the question was how we bring the White House, the Treasury, and the IRS up to speed with our lessons learned. We are a small nonprofit. There were no guarantees that anyone would believe us — trust not only our data, but our ability to do it. </p><p><strong>We felt our need to jump in because we didn’t see it happening anywhere else. </strong>During that period of time, we were still in transition to a new administration, so we knew that the federal government was still building up its digital talent. The private sector was also focused on higher-end clients and how they were going to live in a new online world. Everything was changing during a pandemic, and the only way we were going to reach [families] was through their phones, and trying to be as simplified and trustworthy as possible.</p><p><strong>So in very short order, our engineering team put together a mock-up of what it would look like.</strong> [It showed] what the experience would be, how we would triage, how we would ensure that clients are being taken care of through chat. We were able to turn this around in a couple of weeks, but it was based on 10 years of research. We were really confident in our ability to create a front door that spoke to the clients we were trying to serve. We were less confident in whether or not it would be enough to show [the White House] what's possible.</p><p><strong>In a meeting with the White House and Treasury, we walked through the actual process someone would go through.</strong> Within that, not only did we build trust in terms of the relationship we already had, but the tangibility of seeing the vision of what was possible was a key difference for them. But that took some risk on our part — we had to build it before we knew whether it would actually be a relationship that could lead to the scale we have now proved to have.</p><p><div id="series-box"></div>

With the change, Parikh is now the sole chief executive of the privately held company, a prominent up-and-coming player in cloud security that last year achieved a valuation of $8.3 billion.</p><p>Lacework planned to inform employees of the change on Tuesday. Hatfield, who previously served as president at Pure Storage, leaves Lacework's executive leadership a few months shy of his second year with the company. </p><p>As part of the co-CEO model, Hatfield, who goes by the nickname "Hat," focused on business operations and expansion at Lacework, which has raised $1.85 billion in funding. Hatfield joined Lacework as CEO and chairman in early 2021. He could not immediately be reached Tuesday.</p><p>Parikh joined as co-CEO in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-lacework-jay-parikh" target="_blank">mid-2021</a>, and has focused on product and engineering for the company. The two have known each other for two decades, having previously worked at the same time at Akamai Technologies.</p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Parikh characterized the move as planned and amicable, prompted by conversations between "Hat, myself, and the board" that led to the conclusion that the co-CEO model was no longer the best fit for the company. Lacework's executive leadership and board have been "looking at where the business is and what it needs to get to the next level," and have determined that "unifying the company" under a single CEO made the most sense right now, Parikh said.</p><p>When it comes to Lacework's product and sales strategy and its relationships with customers, partners, and the big public cloud platforms, the move should help with "making sure that's all unified [around] one set of priorities with one focus," he said.</p><p>Parikh said he doesn't believe Hatfield has "any immediate plan to go jump into anything full-time anytime soon." Hatfield is "still going to be spending a good amount of time" on Lacework, Parikh told Protocol.<br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-right" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: right;">

</p><p>Founded in 2014, Lacework offers a "data-driven" service that aims to stand out in the fast-growing cloud security market by collecting and analyzing data from across a customer's cloud environments. The goal is to to provide customers with crucial security insights, such as which threats to prioritize for action, the company has said.</p><p>The company raised a $525 million funding round in January 2021, followed by an additional $1.3 billion in funding in November 2021 that brought with it the $8.3 billion valuation. Lacework touted that round as "the largest funding round in security industry history," and the company ranks at No. 3 in terms of the biggest valuations for privately held security companies, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank">CB Insights</a>.</p><p>Lacework is also notable for having been just the third company to be incubated out of Sutter Hill Ventures, following a model that was used to launch Pure Storage and Snowflake. The Lacework platform supports AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as Kubernetes environments. </p><p>In May, Lacework disclosed that it had laid off <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/lacework-layoffs-cloud-security-startup" target="_blank">20% of its staff</a>, in response to what the co-CEOs <a href="https://www.lacework.com/blog/lacework-update/" target="_blank">then described</a> as a "seismic shift" in "both the public and private markets." The company had previously <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/cybersecurity-has-53-unicorns-here-are-10-to-watch/" target="_blank">reported</a> having more than 1,000 employees as of March, and did not immediately have a figure available for its current employee count on Tuesday.</p><p>Prior to Lacework, Hatfield had previously spent nearly seven years as president at Pure Storage followed by 16 months as its vice chair, according to his LinkedIn. He joined the company as president in 2013, a few years into its founding, and stayed on through its initial public offering and its first several years as a public company.</p><p>While there are no plans to directly replace Hatfield at Lacework, given the unification of the CEO duties under Parikh's leadership, the company does plan to hire a chief revenue officer in the near future, Parikh said.</p><p>Ultimately, Lacework's leadership is focusing on making moves that will set it up "to be successful over 10, 20 years — we're not building this to be a transaction," Parikh said. <br/></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The future of pay transparency in tech https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/pay-transparency-in-tech-sb1162 Tue, 04 Oct 2022 22:07:11 +0000

We spoke with Susan Alban, operating partner and chief people officer at Renegade Partners, and compensation consultant Ashish Raina to learn how.</p><hr/><p><strong>Startups will adopt pay bands earlier.</strong> Five or 10 years ago, it wasn’t unusual for 50-person companies to be operating without a “career ladder” or “career architecture” with compensation bands for different job functions and levels, Alban said.</p><ul><li>Today’s tighter labor market — and demands from candidates — mean that companies structure their compensation bands sooner.</li><li>Because the new law applies to companies with just 15 employees, even tiny startups will be required to define their pay bands in a more structured way, Alban said.</li><li>“Which is a little funky when you have, like, eight people, to have a band for every single job, because sometimes you just have one person in a job,” she said. “It just nudges companies to be a little bit more thoughtful in defining what is the job, what is the relative seniority, and what would we reasonably pay relative to market-based pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>Companies may find other ways to differentiate pay in order to compete for the best talent. </strong>The law only requires companies to disclose base pay, not stock, bonuses, or benefits. </p><ul><li>This means bonuses and equity could become more important forms of compensation, which may shift the issue of unequal pay to other areas.</li><li>Bonuses “can be very arbitrary,” especially in early-stage companies where goals change all the time, Alban said.</li><li>They may prove to be even more important levers for attracting and retaining great employees, however. “Fair pay is not equal pay,” Raina said. “If someone is more proficient or more highly performing in a role, there should be a differentiation in pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>The law might provide a little more incentive for companies to hire outside of California, </strong>but not much. The law on its own is unlikely to have a major effect on where companies hire, but it adds more administrative headache to California employers.</p><ul><li>“I don’t hear employers talking about not wanting to hire in the state of Colorado because of these laws,” Alban said.</li><li>Some companies may choose to advertise jobs with a national labor rate that would overpay candidates in low-cost states like Mississippi but underpay Californians, Raina said.</li></ul><p><strong>Big companies are likely to comply more readily than startups.</strong> An online job search shows companies like Google, Salesforce, and Twitter listing pay ranges in ads. Some listings cite the Colorado law explicitly.</p><ul><li>“I think the general consensus among progressive technology employers is that this is the way the world is going,” Alban said. “Rather than fret about it and deviate from hiring in particular regions to avoid compliance, better to just comply anyway.”</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li>Some startups likely won’t comply with the law, Raina said. “They’re trying to survive,” he said. “Yes, this law exists, and yes, there’s going to be some risk if they don’t comply, but that isn’t necessarily people’s forefront of an issue.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The EU ushers in the USB-C era https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-apple-iphone-ewaste Tue, 04 Oct 2022 19:32:24 +0000

The mandate will extend to laptops in 2026. </p><p>The rule — which was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-charging-ewaste" target="_blank">introduced in June</a> — passed 602-13, while eight members abstaining from voting. That reflects an overwhelming desire to make the average person's life easier (goodbye, cluttered junk drawer) as well as cut down on pernicious e-waste. While the decision means that ports such as micro-USB will fall by the wayside, Apple's Lightning port is also slated to go the way of the dinosaur. </p><p>The company's iPad and various MacBooks rely on USB-C charging. But Apple has held steadfastly to the technology for the iPhone, rolling out its most recent iteration of the phone with a Lightning rather than a USB-C port. The iPhone was the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/31/european-smartphone-market-2021/" target="_blank">bestselling phone</a> in the EU last year, with Apple capturing 34% of the smartphone market.</p><p>The European Council needs to sign off on the legislation before it officially goes into law. But that prospect looks likely. After that, the clock to USB-C hegemony begins counting down. The timing could work out well for Apple at least; the company releases a new iPhone every year in September. With the mandate likely to take effect in fall 2024, it means next year's iPhone could well be the last one to feature a Lightning port — unless Apple decides to just get the switch over with, something the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066661/apple-iphone-15-drop-lightning-port-usb-c-2023-prediction-rumor" target="_blank">company is reportedly considering</a>. </p><p>The company could also make a USB-C version of the iPhone for the EU and a Lightning version for everyone else, of course, but that seems unlikely given the logistical hurdles. The iPhone could also go totally portless for charging, though that would be a much more radical leap. <br/></p><p>As written, the rule would allow electronics without a USB-C port to continue being sold as long as they are "placed on the market before the date of application," according to a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the vote. Regardless, if you're a Lightning stan, uh, you should consider snapping up an iPhone 14 sooner than later.</p><p>Cutting down on e-waste is a sneaky climate policy. The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Pages/Spotlight/Global-Ewaste-Monitor-2020.aspx" target="_blank">Global E-Waste Monitor</a> put out by the United Nations showed that nearly 54 million tons of e-waste piled up in 2020, a number that could rise to almost 75 million tons by the end of this decade. That's a local environmental concern given the toxic chemicals and components. But it's also a huge waste of emissions. More than two-thirds of the carbon pollution tied to electronics is emitted in the manufacturing process. </p><p>Cutting down on the number of charging cables produced (and trashed) is a relatively modest way to cut down on e-waste. Stronger policies that favor right-to-repair as well as companies working harder to stave off forced obsolescence could also offer a pathway to reduce the amount of electronic churn. Improving e-waste recycling is yet another avenue to cut down on trash; the Global E-Waste Monitor found only 17.4% of electronic trash is currently recycled. Apple and other tech companies have touted moving toward a circular economy as central to their sustainability goals. While the EU's USB-C mandate alone won't make that transition magically happen, it could spur further innovation and serve as a reminder of all the work that remains to be done.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Why $100 per ton is the carbon removal industry's holy grail https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-removal-cost-per-ton Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:03:51 +0000

It’s one of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/frontier-cdr-purchases-stripe-alphabet" target="_self">Frontier’s</a> stated criteria that the fund uses to evaluate its advance purchases. In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of the long-duration carbon removal community, CarbonPlan found that stakeholders are focused on the $100 benchmark. The Department of Energy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/climate/glasgow-carbon-removal-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even announced</a> that it would be investing in carbon removal research to bring the cost of the technology down to $100 per ton.</p><hr/><p><strong>Where did that number come from? </strong>In short, it’s the cost per ton of removal services that it would take for the CDR industry to reach commercial viability. It’s based on a handful of factors. </p><ul><li>It’s the point at which carbon removal becomes affordable at the scale needed to make it a meaningful tool to reach net zero (and, eventually, negative emissions), Shuchi Talati, a senior visiting scholar at Carbon180, told Protocol. </li><li>It evolved from modeling and policy conversations, and is aligned with other existing costs, like the European Union’s carbon price (which will likely reach that number in a decade). </li><li>It’s also tied to the social cost of carbon, a metric that measures the economic damage a ton of carbon emitted causes. Estimates of the social cost of carbon keep increasing as climate damages become clearer.</li><li>Another reason could be much simpler. The climate community could just be taking its cue from the DOE, anchoring its own targets to the agency’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Carbon Negative Shot target</a>, which was set for $100 per ton, CarbonPlan’s Danny Cullenward wrote in an email to Protocol.</li></ul><p><strong>So far, no one has come anywhere close to reaching that target. </strong>Currently, most carbon removal services cost well above $100 per ton, although the Inflation Reduction Act’s updated 45Q tax credit of up to $180 per ton for direct air capture could help some startups get closer to achieving that target. </p><p>“$100 per ton is an extremely ambitious 10-year target, likely probably more of a 15- to 20-year target,” Talati said. But she thinks it’s “important to be ambitious,” and “there’s a lot of momentum around CDR and getting these technologies to scale.”</p><p>The world could have to remove <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-needs" target="_self">billions of tons of carbon pollution</a> per year from the atmosphere by midcentury depending on how fast emissions fall in the interim.

Within hours, it had become clear that Stadia’s shutdown, planned for next January, would involve more than just refunding consumer purchases and quietly bowing out.</p><p>Now developers are scrambling to salvage planned projects, migrate players to other platforms, and figure out whether they’re still owed money from Google before the search giant puts Stadia out to pasture for good.</p><hr/><p><strong>Stadia’s shutdown came as a surprise.</strong> Scores of indie game makers, not typically bound by the conservative norms of corporate PR, took to Twitter to explain their frustrations upon learning of the shutdown from news articles and a terse <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five-paragraph blog post</a> from Stadia chief Phil Harrison. </p><ul><li>“Tangle Tower was due to launch on Stadia in 2 days time, and this article was the first I heard about it shutting down,” SFB Games co-founder Tom Vian <a href="https://twitter.com/SFBTom/status/1575558078367690752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Thursday.</li><li>“We have a title coming out November 1st,” Rebecca Heineman, CEO of indie studio Olde Sküül, wrote in response to Vian. “Now we hear about this.” Olde Sküül has since <a href="https://twitter.com/OldeSkuul/status/1575863134857793536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it will release its planned Stadia game, Luxor Evolved, on console and PC in 2023. </li><li>“We have a game coming to Stadia in November.

The consensus: We’re looking into it. </p><ul><li>Ubisoft has been Google’s longest cloud gaming partner, having given the company Assassin’s Creed Origins to test Stadia’s Project Stream predecessor. And with 38 games on the platform, Ubisoft <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> it was “working” to allow Stadia customers to bring those purchases to PC but had nothing more to share. </li><li>“We hear you - we are looking into ways for you to continue your HITMAN experience on other platforms,” <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Hitman developer IO Interactive. </li><li>“All I can say now is that we’re currently looking into the matter, and exploring possible options,” a representative of Cyberpunk 2077 studio CD Projekt Red <a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1576970793006747648" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Verge</a>. </li><li>“We just learned about Stadia shutting down and have begun conversations about next steps for our players,” a Bungie representative <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5Efe3ce7c2836c90e2787ce169a12fbfa6c976cdbd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fdestiny-2-and-hitman-developers-respond-to-google-stadia-shutdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> to the company’s Destiny 2 forums. </li><li>One player of the online component of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 who logged more than 6,000 hours into the game for Twitch and YouTube content has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-onlines-biggest-superfan-may-lose-6000-hours-of-progress-on-stadia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no idea if they can migrate their account</a> off of Stadia. Rockstar has yet to respond to Stadia’s shutdown. </li></ul><p><strong>It’s not clear why Google axed Stadia now,</strong> and why it did so with little to no warning for any of the various parties that invested time, money, and other resources into the platform over the last three years. </p><ul><li>Google is undergoing a serious cost-cutting effort at the moment to contend with the economic downturn. And Stadia was expensive: Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that Stadia spent tens of millions of dollars just to secure rights to a single big-budget release like Red Dead Redemption 2. </li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/google-ceo-says-he-hopes-to-make-company-20percent-more-efficient-hints-at-potential-cuts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last month he wants to make the company “20% more productive,” and hiring slowdowns, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348999/google-pixelbook-canceled-team-shut-down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancellation of a new Pixelbook</a>, and other cost-cutting efforts may have pushed Stadia toward the chopping block.</li><li>Stadia arrived on the gaming scene with big ambitions in 2019 that included developing original exclusives that would make use of the platform’s cloud computing advantages. </li><li>But Google’s internal studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-shuts-down-internal-studios-changing-bus-1846146761" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered</a> less than 18 months after launch, and many of its ambitious cloud features like State Share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-had-big-disruptive-ideas-that-others-should-steal/1100-6507965/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never made it to more than 10% of the platform</a>.</li><li>Ultimately, Stadia chief Harrison said the main culprit was a lack of growth: “While Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected.” </li><li>"The number one problem is the business model. Secondly, you need to deliver something consumers cannot get elsewhere," said Benjy Boxer, the co-founder of game streaming platform Parsec who now oversees the product at Unity. "In my opinion, the only way cloud gaming will ever shift to the mainstream is if we get to a point where we’re not selling the distribution technology and instead selling a unique value proposition." </li><li>Boxer said Stadia had "amazing technology" but failed at selling coherent product and experience. "Stadia never figured out who their customer was," he added.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s perhaps too early to draw broader conclusions about Stadia’s closure,</strong> what it could mean for cloud gaming as a whole, and whether the platform’s demise is the nail in the coffin for Google’s gaming ambitions. But Google’s sloppy handling of the announcement and Stadia’s stunning failure is evidence that even the largest, most experienced companies can find themselves lost in the woods when trying to crack such a notoriously difficult set of problems. </p><p>Cloud gaming is still available on platforms operated by Microsoft, Nvidia, and — for the time being — Amazon, too. But developing games is costly, difficult, and multidisciplinary work that takes years, and streaming those games over the cloud has yet to be accomplished in a sustainable fashion with an attractive business model. Google found this out the hard way, and let’s hope Stadia’s shutdown provides the road map that helps keep its competitors alive.</p><p><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Entertainment newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={This carbon capture startup wants to decarbonize the world’s biggest polluters https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-clean-point-source-capture Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:47:57 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/ceo-and-co-founder-of-carbon-clean-aniruddha-sharma.jpg?id=31859764&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C256%2C0%2C412"/><br/><br/><p>Carbon capture and storage has taken on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-capture-venture-capital-investment" target="_self">increasing importance</a> as companies with stubborn emissions look for new ways to meet their net zero goals. For hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel production, it’s one of the few options that exist to help them get there. </p><p>Yet it’s proven incredibly challenging to scale the technology, which captures carbon pollution at the source. U.K.-based company Carbon Clean is leading the charge to bring down costs. This year, it raised a $150 million series C round, which the startup said is the largest-ever funding round for a point-source carbon capture company. </p><p>Carbon capture and storage is controversial in part due to the industries it serves; while cement and steel makers are among the industries that all but require CCS to lower emissions, oil and gas companies have also shown great interest. Carbon Clean’s latest funding round was led by Chevron, and the technology is seen as a potential lifeline for the fossil fuel industry, despite there being readily available alternatives like renewables and electric vehicles. </p><p>The technology has also been criticized for not delivering the emissions reductions it promises. That includes an infamous case last year involving none other than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/a-shocking-failure-chevron-criticised-for-missing-carbon-capture-target-at-wa-gas-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevron in Western Australia</a>, in which the company missed its targets, and a Shell blue hydrogen project that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shell-ccs-carbon-capture-1848401554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emitted more carbon than it captured</a>. The <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> has also lambasted the Department of Energy for investing $1.1 billion in projects that largely failed to live up to expectations.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop that Carbon Clean is striving to clean up CCS’ image and deliver on its promise. Carbon Clean CEO Aniruddha Sharma told Protocol that fossil fuels are necessary, at least in the near term, to lift the living standards of those who don’t have access to cars and electricity.</p><p>While technologies like CCS hold a lot of promise, helping the world potentially address that issue while still meeting net zero goals, the risks of locking in more fossil fuel use are real, especially if Carbon Clean and other CCS companies can’t scale as promised. CCS also does nothing to help with other forms of local air pollution, which is a major public health concern. </p><p>Sharma, for his part, said he has “done nothing else but carbon capture” his professional life. Along with co-founder and CTO Prateek Bumb, he started working on Carbon Clean’s technology out of university. Bumb had done a five-month internship in Italy studying decarbonization science, and Sharma asked him who was doing that work in India. “No one,” he told him, and thus Carbon Clean was born.</p><p>He spoke to Protocol about what Carbon Clean has learned, the future of point-source CCS, as well as the role of companies like his in battling the climate crisis.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What’s the most challenging part of carbon capture that you’re still working through?</strong></p><p>Scale up is the most challenging part. The technology is working right now. Going from here to the next level of scale up, maybe 10 times bigger, is going to be interesting and challenging, both because you’re trying to increase the equipment size and you’re trying to increase our supply chain. Once you’ve got the materials, then you need a workshop or machining capacity capability that can actually produce the equipment specifically for you. But in the current atmosphere, that’s not something that’s necessarily available. So we’re spending a lot of time on how we scale up both the supply chain and the equipment and the delivery capability.</p><p><strong>You just raised a $150 million series C led by Chevron. A bulk of your investment comes from fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco and Equinor. How do you make sure your work isn’t just a way for them to pay to continue polluting?</strong></p><p>President Biden is asking oil and gas companies to produce more oil, but they’re not necessarily producing that much oil because the market doesn’t necessarily see producing fossil fuels as a good thing to do. So I think people realize that there is a need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and work towards the energy transition. </p><p>From our perspective, whenever you partner with companies like Chevron, we always look for proof in the pudding. Chevron has committed $10 billion to Chevron New Energies, which is solely working on decarbonization. If they have the biggest footprint today, they’re the ones that need the most help decarbonizing. </p><p><strong>How do you make sure the removal project doesn’t negatively impact the local communities adjacent to the carbon capture?</strong></p><p>I think the issue is much deeper: How does the energy transition in general impact the population and the people being affected by it? When these companies start reducing their production, there will be more jobs available and you can reorient a lot of them towards decarbonization. We’re also leading the creation of a new industry that actually didn’t exist. If you think about decarbonization and the level where we need to be — or should be — over the next 10 years, you’re talking about creating five companies the size of Exxon or Chevron in the decarbonization space. These companies will employ tens of thousands of people, so we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of job opportunities to be created for decarbonization. For our company, we ensure that the impact of what we’re trying to do is translated into the local communities.</p><p><strong>How much should your corporate clients be relying on your services when it comes to reaching their net zero or decarbonization goals? In other words, what proportion of their drawdown should come from emissions reductions versus paying for point-source carbon capture?</strong> </p><p>I generally advise our customers to diversify their options. I tell my customers that in 2024, get one unit at your site and spend 10% of your money for decarbonization using one of our carbon capture boxes, spend 10% for another form of decarbonization, and another 10% for electrification, and maybe another 10% for biomass. Try all the options across the board, so that within a year or two, you know which one or two options to scale up. Maybe carbon capture and electrification are the best options for you. If you’re in California, green hydrogen carbon capture is the perfect option for you, so we’re not saying that ours is the only solution. </p><p><strong>But how much of their decarbonization journey should come from any sort of carbon capture versus just not having that pollution be released at all?</strong></p><p>I think that’s where the conundrum is, right? We help decarbonize heavy industries like steel and cement, which are relatively difficult to replace in the medium term. </p><p><strong>But you also work with fossil fuel companies, for which there are renewable alternatives.</strong> </p><p>We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity? We have to keep using heavy industrial products for some time more. And we cannot allow them to just run like that; we have to decarbonize them today. </p><p class="pull-quote">"We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity?"</p><p><strong>So is it your hope that eventually your company won’t have to exist?<br/><br/></strong>I think heavy industry will always exist. So we’ll always be there supporting the decarbonization. If you think about brute numbers, 2 billion people today don’t have access to electricity. <em>[Editor’s note: The International Energy Agency pegs that number at </em><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity" target="_blank"><em>770 million</em></a><em>.] </em>How much of an industrial output needs to be produced to elevate and alleviate poverty for 2 billion people? It’d be immoral to say, “Well, actually, you know what, steel and cement companies, stop tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Bigger picture: How much CCS does the world need? Put a number on what you expect. A gigaton? Less? More?</strong></p><p>Let’s work backwards. Industrial emitters today contribute about 25% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, more or less. That’s about 10 billion tons of emissions. Even if you said that we will be able to electrify some of it or use hydrogen for some part of it, you would still need to decarbonize a significant chunk of that 10 billion tons using point-source carbon capture technologies, and they need to happen between now and 2040. As a company, we are focused on scaling our solution and the availability of that solution to a billion tons per year of carbon dioxide captured. </p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Musk may buy Twitter after all https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:41:39 +0000

While most firms fell into the range of cutting staff two to three months after making funding announcements, a handful of companies waited two weeks or less after going public about funding rounds before making layoffs. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" frameborder="0" height="450" id="datawrapper-chart-gI4RQ" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gI4RQ/5/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Layoffs after announcing new funding"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r</script></div><p><br/></p><p>Are firms blowing through millions in the weeks after the check is deposited in the bank? Experts told Protocol that it's more complicated than that. Startups wait several months to a year after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public with the news, but the delay can result in terrible optics and often a feeling of betrayal among those laid off. </p><h3> Keeping it quiet</h3><p>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” said Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners. A founder may not want their competitors to know about funding, or want to wait until there are other announcements to tack onto a funding round, like a product release or a new executive hire, to do a press push. </p><p>Funding details become more exclusive the bigger an organization gets. At a company with 100 employees, it's easier to keep the news of a major hire or a big VC check from slipping. But at a company with 2,000 people, “announcing it internally is announcing it publicly,” said Alban. “Even if you know everyone is under an NDA, you don't announce something at an all-hands with 2,000 people without expecting that it's going to be leaked.” </p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/business/bolt-layoffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1534872800439279618" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/07/01/homelight-lays-off-a-fifth-of-its-workers-weeks-after-raising-60m/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HomeLight</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/stord-slashes-jobs-after-new-funding-5884514/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stord</a> all drew attention from funding announcements that happened just weeks or days before layoffs.

Plus, big funding announcements don’t always equate to a company’s financial health. Travel startup <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/05/31/pollen-reported-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pollen</a> cut staff after raising funding and collapsed just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/the-next-fyre-fest-startup-pollen-leaves-people-seeking-refunds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three months later</a>. </p><p>Though it’s impossible to know the financial guts of a company from the outside, many will conduct layoffs to extend their runway, Anthony Kline, partner at The GP, told Protocol. Prior to the recent downturn, venture capitalists were “seeing a bit of a gold rush” in tech. But as things have slowed, funding rounds have become harder and harder to come by. “You're able to see the caboose now; you're not gonna see, like, an infinite line of cars.” </p><p>As the economy shifted, so did the role of the founder and CEO, Kline said, changing from “growth product leader to resource allocator.” Jobs that don’t directly align with generating revenue or are duplicate roles are first on the chopping block.</p><p>“If they don't assume that there's some additional round of funding that’s 12 months out, it might be 24 or 36 months out, then they have to be a little bit more creative and a little bit more resourceful,” Kline said. </p><h3>It sucks no matter what</h3><p>It’s difficult to predict if a company will have rocky times ahead, but smart leaders can plan ahead about when to announce funding. If the announcement comes months or a year after closing the round, it gives the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. And, optics aside, layoffs after funding announcements (and in general) are a blow to internal morale. Doing them in a transparent and thoughtful way is crucial. </p><p>Having employees be in the know about company details, financial standing, and what the future of the company looks like might help ease the blow of layoffs. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Kline. </p><p>Being present with your staff amid layoffs, especially in a time of increased remote work, is important to let employees know you’re not disconnected and you’re listening to how layoffs impact them. </p><p>“You see a lot of situations where a founder is so preoccupied with allocating resources, talking to investors, or talking to customers, that they're spending most of their time externally and less so internally,” Kline said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Gary Gensler is keeping up with Kim Kardashian https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/kim-kardashian-emax-crypto-sec Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:23:09 +0000

Kim Kardashian <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax" target="_self">agreed to pay a $1.26 million penalty</a> for failing to report that she got paid to endorse EMAX tokens. It’s a high-profile affirmation of the SEC’s controversial position that most cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities, and just like stock promoters, celebrities better follow the rules if they want to pitch a token to the public.</p><p><strong>Disclosure rules. </strong>“Ms. Kardashian’s case” is a reminder that celebrities must “disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities" like crypto tokens, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183" target="_blank">Gensler said</a>.</p><ul><li>The SEC had actually put out this warning even before Gensler’s time in the wake of the ICO craze a few years ago. In 2017, the regulator cautioned investors <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-potentially-unlawful-promotion-icos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“to be wary of investment opportunities</a> that sound too good to be true” and of “paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons.”</li><li>The following year the SEC announced that boxer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled</a> agreed to pay “disgorgement, penalties and interest” for failing to report that they got paid for touting initial coin offerings. </li></ul><p><strong>The cases underline the perils of celebrity endorsements in the world of investment finance,</strong> where “you can't be paid to promote a stock without disclosing that you're being paid,” Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco regional director, told Protocol. </p><ul><li>Online influencers make a living on hype. But in the world of securities, “overexuberance without proper disclosures and disclaimers is going to be considered misleading and is going to get people in hot water,” Andrew Lom, global head of private wealth at Norton Rose Fulbright, told Protocol. </li><li>Mike Fasanello, chief compliance officer at LVL, said “a seasoned businesswoman like Ms. Kardashian really should have known better considering her career is built largely on advertising and her public image.”</li></ul><p><strong>It’s a significant PR moment for the SEC. </strong>While the regulator has gone after other offending crypto celebrities, the Kardashian case is a “bigger win,” Fagel argued.</p><ul><li>She’s a huge celebrity, after all, whose popularity extends beyond the crypto and finance realms. “There are a lot more people reading about Kim Kardashian” than scouring other cases and news stories involving crypto, he told Protocol. The federal government “has an interest in bringing high-profile cases as a deterrent matter because it gets a lot more attention.”</li><li>In fact, the Kardashian case “may turn into the best public service announcement not to take investment advice from a celebrity,” Bill Callahan, director of government strategic affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. It could also serve as a “warning to others that they must settle their investigations by the SEC” and other law enforcement agencies.</li><li>The fine Kardashian has to pay is “a nominal penalty considering her overall net worth,” Fasanello said. But the SEC action “is meant to educate the masses rather than to penalize the individual.”</li></ul><p>“Simply being a crypto enthusiast publicly isn't going to get anyone in trouble,” even among celebrities, Melody Brue of Moor Insights & Strategy told Protocol. In other words, Matt Damon is probably off the hook for saying that “fortune favors the brave” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crypto.com ad</a>. But trying to make money from touting crypto products is a serious matter, Brue added: “However vague you believe crypto as a security rule to be, it's clear Gensler is going to apply the same regulations, disclosure requirements, and marketing rules that are applied to securities.” </p><p><em>— Benjamin Pimentel (</em><a href="mailto:bpimentel@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="http://twitter.com/benpimentel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM ALIBABA</h3><br/><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="8959dd775f8b0d912fadd71e203ba533" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123996622&iu=/21901267728" id="daa0e" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843641&width=980"/></a><p>Alibaba — a leading global ecommerce company — is a particularly powerful engine in helping American businesses of every size sell goods to more than 1 billion consumers on its digital marketplaces in China.

The outcome could make or break an industry increasingly central to tech companies meeting their net zero goals.</p><p>Globally, Verra — short for the Verified Carbon Standard — issues roughly two-thirds of the carbon credits on the voluntary market, including credits for renewable energy and forestry and land use, among other types. Established in 2007, the registry is the longtime face of the market’s status quo.</p><p>But as demand has surged for carbon credits — particularly as the tech industry looks to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-offsets-shopping-ecommerce" target="_self">meet its net zero targets</a> by offsetting a (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/tech-climate-plan-tips?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">small</a>) portion of its emissions — it has become increasingly clear that scaling the credit market will first require clear standards and transparency. In fact, this is precisely the conclusion that forced a 400-member industry task force on scaling the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/carney-s-bid-to-boost-carbon-market-scaled-back-amid-controversy?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to change tack</a> in 2021. In its wake, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market emerged. It published proposed reforms — including establishing an agreed-upon definition for credit quality and evaluating methodologies accordingly — in July. </p><p>While Verra initially supported the effort, it has since taken issue with the specifics of even these modest potential reforms. Last week, the organization demanded that the council make a “course correction” and took particular issue with the approach that gives credit types that meet the quality definition a thumbs-up in a note to stakeholders.</p><p>“We especially fear that the principles-based review of programs has been supplanted with a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach that seeks to directly set the scope and rules of the market,” Verra wrote in mid-September. Verra also argued for program-by-program evaluation rather than one that evaluates the quality of specific credit types.</p><p>In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/verra-integrity-council" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new analysis</a>, the climate research nonprofit CarbonPlan said Verra’s objection was “melodramatic” and “about control.” </p><p>“The Integrity Council is running a voluntary, opt-in labeling effort — nothing more,” the CarbonPlan team wrote last week. “The Integrity Council isn’t proposing to do anything about credits that fall short of its standards, nor is it clear how they could if they wanted to.”</p><p>Carbon markets are essentially the Wild West. Countless methodologies exist to define what makes for a quality credit, and imposing order on any lawless frontier is proving to be a challenge. But the stakes couldn’t be higher. </p><p>A <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/reform-needed-to-unlock-550-billion-carbon-offsets-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF analysis</a> found that the carbon offset market could be worth as much as $550 billion by 2050, a time period when net zero commitments will come due. However, absent global standard-setting, it is possible that there won’t be enough quality offsets to keep up to the demand. That could mean a lot of money gets wasted on ineffective credits while causing the planet to overheat to dangerous levels. </p><p>The fact that this initial attempt does not have the support of the voluntary market’s biggest player does not bode well. CarbonPlan speculated that at the root of Verra’s objection is a concern that its credits are not “robust enough” to meet the benchmark set out by the council’s proposal, and that new standards “could threaten their dominant position on the supply side of the voluntary market.”</p><p>Verra, for its part, maintains that its concerns are with the process’s efficiency, not with its proposed scrutiny. </p><p>“We don’t wish to see good projects unable to move ahead because the methodology they are using is waiting too long in line for its assessment,” Andrew Howard, Verra’s senior director for climate policy and strategy, told Protocol. “Verra is confident the VCS program will meet the ICVCM’s quality thresholds.”</p><p>Verra proposed several specific “course corrections” for the council, ostensibly with efficiency in mind. First, it argued for evaluating entire programs rather than specific credit types or methodologies. CarbonPlan said that approach “doesn’t pass the laugh test” given that it would force the council to give the whole swath of Verra credits a thumbs-up without acknowledging how much, for instance, a renewable energy credit’s methodology might differ from that of a forestry credit. </p><p>“That is no way to confront the well-documented challenges in the voluntary carbon markets, many of which are present in Verra’s offerings, and it would force the Integrity Council to either bless most of the market uncritically or categorically exclude its largest player,” CarbonPlan said. </p><p>In response, Verra said the council should sample or use spot checks to make sure all of a program’s credit types deserve the council’s approval, but that relying on a methodology-by-methodology evaluation rather than more efficient approaches would leave the council at risk of “seriously bogged down.” </p><p>Verra also took issue with the proposal to step up standards over time and suggested that the council use existing aviation industry offset standards. Taking that approach, though, would ignore the very real need for sharper offset standards and the reality that the aviation industry’s standards are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-un-just-made-it-easier-for-airlines-to-pollute-1844251411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rife with loopholes</a>.</p><p>Regardless of what shape the council’s final reforms take, though, Verra doesn’t have to participate in the council’s proposed benchmarking if it doesn’t want to. If the registry does opt out, it would seriously undermine the scope of any new standards by making two in three carbon credits exempt. </p><p>That puts the council in the midst of a tug-of-war as Verra pulls it to change its plan and CarbonPlan and its other supporters urge it to stay the course. Should the council allow itself to be swayed by Verra’s concerns, CarbonPlan said it could put its very independence at risk.</p><p>“Either [the council members] accede to Verra’s demands and abandon any claim to independence, or they forge ahead and work with only a minority of the current market,” CarbonPlan <a href="https://twitter.com/carbonplanorg/status/1575549005265653760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summarized via Twitter</a>. “We hope they will choose the latter.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={White House AI Bill of Rights lacks specific recommendations for AI rules https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights Tue, 04 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

And, linking to an article about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveillance tech used in China</a> to track and control the Muslim minority Uyghur population there, they alluded to use of AI by autocracies “as a tool of state-sponsored oppression, division, and discrimination.”</p><p class="pull-quote">I categorically reject that kind of framing of it,” Nelson told Protocol. “The document moves as the title says from principles to practice.</p><p>Soon after the announcement, OSTP held several <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public listening sessions</a> in November 2021 on AI-enabled biometric technologies, consumer and “smart city” products, and AI used for employment, education, housing, health care, social welfare, financial services, and in the criminal justice system.</p><p>While some advocacy groups have indicated <a href="https://www.caidp.org/statements/ostp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustration with the slow process</a> for publishing the AI Bill of Rights, Nelson said by one measure — the Biden-Harris administration’s <a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Summit for Democracy</a> held in December 2021 — it is actually early. <br/><br/>“We had committed by December to finish this, and we are completing it with a little bit of time to spare,” Nelson said.</p><p>Scandal has plagued OSTP this year. Former OSTP Director <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/eric-lander-resigns-00006545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lander resigned In February</a> amid accusations he created “an atmosphere of intimidation at OSTP through flagrant verbal abuse.” Later in March, POLITICO revealed that Lander had helped enable an organization led by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to pay the salaries of some OSTP staff.<br/><br/></a>Lawmakers have proposed legislation that would take ethical commitments made by the government out of the realm of theory and into practice. Legislation introduced in February, for example, would <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/revised-algorithmic-accountability-bill-ai" target="_self">require companies to assess the impact of AI</a> and automated systems they use to make decisions affecting people’s employment, finances, and housing and require those companies to submit annual reports about assessments to the FTC.</p><p>Despite a lack of federal AI laws or regulations, the U.S. has agreed to uphold international <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles established in 2019 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> that call on makers and users of AI systems to be held accountable for them, and ensure they respect human rights and democratic values including privacy, non-discrimination, fairness, and labor rights. Those principles also called on AI builders and users to make sure that the systems are transparent, provide understandable and traceable explanations for their decisions, and are safe and secure.</p><p>In conjunction with the publication of the AI Bill of Rights, other federal agencies are expected to signal commitment to take actions reflective of its tenets. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services plans to release recommendations for methods to reduce algorithmic discrimination in health care AI and the Department of Education is planning to release recommendations on the use of AI for teaching and learning by early 2023.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The US is set to expand controls on chip tech for China this week https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/us-china-chips-export-controls Mon, 03 Oct 2022 23:01:22 +0000

Thursday’s announcement is expected to include export controls on chipmaking tools.</p><p>In late August, Nvidia and AMD disclosed they had received notification letters from the Commerce Department ordering them to halt sales of chips designed for artificial intelligence computing.

High-bandwidth memory (which is useful for training large AI models) and flash were among the memory technologies under consideration, the people said. </p><p>Administration officials had been briefed by several memory manufacturers about establishing specific thresholds for flash and high-bandwidth memory, according to another person familiar with the discussions.

The stakes for the legal status quo underpinning the entirety of modern social media are potentially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/texas-elon-musk-free-speech?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">huge</a>, and the outcome is far from certain.</p><p><strong>The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/supreme-court-scrutinize-us-protections-social-media-2022-10-03/" target="_blank">said</a> it will hear <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gonzalez-v-google-llc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a case</a> involving terrorist content on YouTube and whether or not Section 230 immunizes platforms’ algorithms.</strong></p><ul><li>Section 230, of course, says that web platforms, from newspaper comment sections and email providers to Big Tech platforms like Google, can’t be sued over posts that are “provided by another” — a.k.a., by users.</li><li>One of the many, many questions swirling around this law is, when do platforms become so involved with the content that they cease to be separate from users, and can be sued?</li><li>Is it when they were alerted to content by user reports? How about when they promote the content through algorithms? When they add their own warning about it?</li></ul><p><strong>Up until now, federal districts and appeals courts have basically ruled “no” to all of the above,</strong> reasoning that if any were the case, platforms would have to either check almost every single post or ignore all of them.</p><ul><li>Both extremes would be bad for business — a big concern at the dawn of the internet age, in 1996, when the law passed.</li><li>Checking every post (and taking down all the ones that raise any worry of even frivolous litigation) obviously would be bad for free speech.</li><li>But creating a free-for-all would make platforms intensely toxic. The moderation that platforms <em>do</em> do is both arguably both <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/meta-midterms-global-democracy-2023" target="_self">insufficient</a> and also the only thing making some platforms tolerable. </li></ul><p>Under that legal approach, the algorithms that order and recommend content — which, from a technological point of view, are basically the entire point and purpose of social media — <strong>don’t create lawsuit risk for the platforms.</strong></p><ul><li>Nor do fact-checks, labels, failures to act on warnings, and lots of other things.</li><li>It’s not just takedowns and other forms of moderation: Leaving content up and doing nothing with it is also completely fine, under the law.</li></ul><p>Of course, <strong>there’s bipartisan anger that this setup creates huge levels of harm without recourse for those who got hurt, even as some tech companies have gotten very rich.</strong></p><ul><li>Much of that anger focuses on harm that happens at algorithmic scale — whether it’s the spread of child sexual abuse material or mass harassment — because of boosting by Big Tech companies’ very <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/design-wars-ca" target="_self">own</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/california-privacy-transparency?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">designs</a>.</li><li>The case — and an additional case the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/twitter-inc-v-taamneh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will hear</a> involving Twitter — involves terrorist content and attacks, and could offer SCOTUS the ability to narrow court interpretation about just how free social services are to be, well, what they are.</li><li>There may be <a href="https://twitter.com/jkosseff/status/1576934189643239424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real appetite</a> for that kind of narrowing, in fact: The justices appear to have taken up the issue despite the lack of any disagreement in circuit courts, which is more often what <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/section-230-snap" target="_self">prompts</a> them to hear a case.</li></ul><p>By the way, if you thought it was a different issue that touched on Section 230 and seemed <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/hb20-fifth-circuit-stay" target="_self">destined for the Supreme Court</a> — namely,<strong> whether states can require platforms to host conservative content — the justices still could take that up too.</strong></p><p><strong>Both sets of cases create huge uncertainty for tech, though of course a ruling confirming the status quo is possible in both.</strong></p><ul><li>The court may also decide to rule narrowly and only find a small loophole for existing statutes on terrorist content.</li><li>Maybe the justices will follow the framing of the Twitter case and sidestep algorithms altogether, focusing instead on liability in anti-terrorism law.</li><li>But the breadth of potential questions is staggering here, including free speech and design.</li></ul><p>And unlike most of the contentious issues, where the ideological lineup of the court is a good predictor of the outcome, <strong>Section 230 has <a href="https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1576933341894705152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foes</a> and defenders on both sides, and for the most part, we don’t know where the nine justices fall.</strong></p><ul><li>The one exception is arch-conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-section-230" target="_self">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-230-meta" target="_self">called</a> for narrowing when companies get to benefit from the law and for expanding the circumstances where they’re responsible for content.</li></ul><p>I wrote a few weeks ago that the possibility of the Supreme Court taking up the Florida and Texas laws had a real “<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/texas-scotus-issues?rebelltitem=4" target="_self">season finale</a>” vibe — no one knows what’s going to happen and seemingly everything is on the table.

Microsoft Solutions Partners also can earn specializations and expert program status that recognize their expertise and experience in specific technical scenarios under each solution area. </p><p>“What I think is unique about the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is it gives customers total clarity on the partner that has the designations, the specializations that are a great fit for their needs for whatever unique cloud solutions they’re looking for or the transformation that they’re trying to get after,” Dezen said. “It’s like a clear road map, so to speak.”</p><p>A 12-year Microsoft veteran, Dezen most recently served as corporate vice president of device partner sales.

What this means for partners is that they get to differentiate themselves in a very competitive market to customers.</p><p>It’s a really important moment to showcase to partners that we are evolving … as the market is evolving, and we are introducing new capabilities in our programs that let partners focus on their own innovation, leverage our R&D investments, and help customers. The program makes it very easy for partners to understand the things that they need to do to activate all of the resources that we uniquely deliver to partners, whether that’s our R&D investments, our go-to-market scale and capability, or innovation.</p><p>Partners can plug in via skilling, incentives, [or] investments to make sure that they’re getting the best of what I think is Microsoft’s unique differentiation, which is our tech stack plus the combination of the way we go to market, which is the asset of our commercial marketplace combined with our 35,000 [Microsoft field] sellers.</p><p><strong>What’s been the reaction among partners?</strong></p><p>We’ve spent the last six months talking to partners, listening to their feedback, answering their questions. I’m really optimistic that the partners are excited about what we’re doing. They’re excited about the [timing] of this. They see that the portfolio of assets that we’re bringing together with a trusted platform, services, products, and investments for them are so aligned to the way that customers are actually buying products. And it’s aligned to the way that Microsoft sells, so it’s an accelerant for the partners.</p><p><strong>What percentage of partners have decided to join the new program versus renewing their legacy statuses for a year?</strong></p><p>We’re not disclosing specific numbers, but what I will say is partners have the ability to start earning designations immediately. And for partners that aren’t quite ready — first of all, we’re leaning in with resources to help partners make that shift — but they can continue to enjoy their competency benefits uninterrupted through their annual term. They can even renew those benefits after the Silver and Gold badges have retired.</p><p>When Microsoft announced the new program in March, it said partners’ preliminary partner capability scores would be available then, and they had to achieve at least 70 points out of 100 to earn a designation. What percentage of partners needed Microsoft’s help in getting to 70 points?</p><p>Every partner is in a different place on their journey. We have broad-reaching guidance through our partner center that tells partners exactly how they can improve their score in the different categories: performance, skilling, and customer success. Partners can start earning those designations immediately. There are some partners that are well on their way. </p><p>Partners still remain our partners regardless of their designation, and so we’re always going to look for ways to support our partners through any evolutions that are happening with us and in the market. I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are. But I really believe that this program is the thing that’s going to differentiate partners, and so it’s in our interest, in our partners’ interest, and frankly, in the customers’ interests, for partners to lean in and do this work with us.</p><p><strong>The economy has tumbled since Microsoft announced the changes that take effect today. Were any considerations given to partners that might be experiencing economic challenges?</strong></p><p>I actually think the time is better than ever. This is a challenging market, there’s no question about it, but customers need help. They need help to digitally transform, and it’s in their economic interest to do that. We’re giving partners the skills, the resources, the assets, and the partnership to enable them to show customers how they can run their businesses more cost-effectively digitally.</p><p class="pull-quote">I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the changes coming with the industry designations for ISVs?</strong></p><p>There are actually two immediate investments that we’re making around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/program-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ISV Success</a>, which is the pathway for ISVs within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, and then the industry designations. Those are going to be available later this year. They will differentiate solutions based on the demonstrated performance with customers, their technical maturity, and customer success. The first three industries are health care, retail, and financial services. It’s designed with the intent that it will help these ISVs differentiate their solutions by both industry-specific scenarios as well as the broader technology and line-of-business capabilities.</p><p><strong>Can you give a sneak peek of anything else that’s coming after these changes?</strong></p><p>The way to think about it is the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is designed for every partner. We want to invite every partner to participate in it. So the things that you could expect to see in the future are more design capabilities for partners like device partners, mixed-reality partners, learning partners, success partners. We’ll have more specific capabilities roll out as we advance the program.</p><p><strong>What are some common problems or challenges that partners have communicated to you?</strong></p><p>Partners are deciding how quickly they can evolve and modernize their businesses. That’s pretty core to the discussions that we have with partners all the time: How can we help them? How can we help them make more money? How can we help them run thriving, profitable businesses to help their own employees?</p><p>We just published [Microsoft-commissioned research] <a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/microsoft-ecosystem-value-new-data-reveals-partner-paths-to-profitability-and-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from IDC</a>. It’s a great illustration: It talks about how partners that invest with Microsoft see distinct business value and growth. There’s really two things that popped for me. One was that partners that engage deeply with Microsoft see faster growth and higher margins. Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year. The second one is around co-selling and going to market with us. The research showed that the most successful partners we have are engaging across the variety of go-to-market resources with us. These are partners that develop differentiated, value-added approaches to customers that align with Microsoft’s strategy. </p><p class="pull-quote">Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year.</p><p><strong>Are there any emerging technology areas where you’d like to see more partners investing in?</strong></p><p>I’d like to see more partners in all of our solution areas. The party’s open. There are some things that are very timely: certainly security, data, and AI. These are very hot and relevant topics for customers right now, and so that’s pretty core to the conversations that we’re having with our partners.</p><p><strong>Are you going to get involved in trying to bring more female-led partners into the program and promoting greater diversity overall?</strong></p><p>I have a massive responsibility to be a loud voice for diversity and representation in the ecosystem. Any things that we can do to help more diverse partner types participate in our programs, build their own businesses with Microsoft, and then help customers, for me that’s not just a professional win, it’s a personal one.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Tech recruiters' best tips for sourcing talent on LinkedIn https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/best-practices-linkedin-talent-sourcing Mon, 03 Oct 2022 16:54:39 +0000

Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p><hr/><p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul><p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul><p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul><p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul></ul><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Kim Kardashian will pay $1.26 million over crypto post, SEC says https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax Mon, 03 Oct 2022 13:05:05 +0000

Since then the landscape for productivity startups trying to make it on their own has completely changed, especially for those pandemic darlings that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=16f2286b6490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flourished in the all-remote world</a>. </p><p>As recession looms, companies looking to cut costs are less likely to spend money on tools outside of their Microsoft or Google workplace bundles. Enterprise platforms are bulking up and it could spell trouble for the productivity startups trying to unseat them. But Notion COO Akshay Kothari says the company is still aiming to build the next Microsoft, not be the next Microsoft. And in a move signaling a new chapter of maturity, Notion has hired its first chief financial officer: Rama Katkar, Instacart’s former VP of finance.</p><p>Figma, which Kothari called a “sister company” to Notion, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/adobe-to-acquire-figma" target="_self">decided to join Adobe</a> for $20 billion instead of beating them. But Notion is hungry for more. Unlike other startups that have pared down during the downturn, Notion has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-flowdash-acquisition-tender-offer" target="_self">gone on the offensive</a> with acquisitions of calendar app Cron and workflow app Flowdash, as well as launching a global ad campaign. Notion also retained its valuation after <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sequoia-index-purchase-shares-from-notion-employees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees sold shares to investors in a tender offer</a>. Kothari said he doesn’t feel Notion has to “entertain any discussions” about being acquired; there’s more room for Notion to grow, he said, both in the consumer and enterprise spaces. </p><p>“It's almost not worth thinking about the hypotheticals because there's just so much that is left to be done, that we could do ourselves,” Kothari said. </p><h3>IPO or no? </h3><p>Katkar’s hire is a sign Notion may even go public in the near future. The CFO has some experience in this area (Katkar prepped Instacart for its impending, and lately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instacart-plans-to-focus-ipo-on-selling-employee-shares-11663581602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat troubled</a>, IPO.) When Protocol asked about Notion’s IPO plans, she didn’t commit to a “yes” or “no.” Instead, Katkar said Notion is “focused on building” and tackling the international knowledge worker market. </p><p>Whenever a late-stage private company hires a CFO, that means they’re thinking about “the next step,” Wing Venture Capital partner Zach DeWitt said. Going public is typically this next step, and so hiring a CFO with public company or IPO-readiness experience is the way to go. “Usually around $5 million of revenue is when a company starts talking about a VP of finance,” DeWitt said. “By the time the company has $50 million of ARR, they should definitely have a CFO, in the majority of cases.”</p><p>At Instacart and before that at Credit Karma, Katkar developed the financial processes and functions necessary for a maturing company. These IPO-readiness skills apply to private companies too, she noted. </p><p>“That concept of public company readiness is just a framework,” Katkar said. “But in reality, I think even large private companies benefit from operating that way.”</p><p>Katkar was the No. 2 financial officer at both Instacart and Credit Karma, and she feels ready to take on the CFO role. Notion was at the top of her list for its simultaneous consumer and enterprise focus, Katkar said. </p><h3>B to C to B</h3><p>Kothari describes Notion as a “B2C2B” company. Notion doesn’t target CIOs, but rather consumers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-conference-enterprise-productivity-influencer" target="_self">who then work to formalize Notion</a> inside their companies, the so-called <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/cio-shadow-it-saas" target="_self">shadow IT</a> or, in Notion world, “Notion Champions.” Lately, Notion has been working on making its product more translatable for large companies, adding <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-08-29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more admin controls and specific workspaces for teams</a>. But Kothari said he’s not forcing Notion into the enterprise at this point. </p><p>“Eventually, we'll get to a point where we can actually go up to the CIO of a company, who's never heard of Notion, and convince them to roll out Notion company-wide,” Kothari said. “But most of the work right now is happening through the employees, through the community.”</p><p>Notion’s ad campaign, with billboards in London, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco, emphasizes the note-taking tool’s ability to help organize personal life, not just work. Kothari also pointed to the company’s New York City and San Francisco pop-up stands offering bucket hats and coffee as part of the broader brand campaign. This type of branding, as well as the company’s investment in and popularity on TikTok, helps target Gen Z and students who might become Notion worker-champions someday. </p><p>“We can put our energy into making sure our consumers get to use the product for free because we know that downstream, that leads to a B2B business being built in the long run,” Kothari said. </p><p>But Notion’s B2B approach is ultimately not as strong when going up against enterprise software giants with stronger distribution models. DeWitt pointed out that Notion’s valuation is similar to Figma’s at $10 billion, making it a potential candidate for a lucrative acquisition someday. “I’m sure there are some large companies, like Microsoft would be a natural buyer here, maybe even Salesforce, that are thinking about potentially acquiring Notion,” DeWitt said. “It’s a great category, a great team, a great product. It’s got a lot of momentum.”</p><p>Kothari said he feels a close kinship with Figma, as the two companies had similar growth trajectories and similar <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/adobe-figma-dylan-field-user-reactions" target="_self">obsessive, loyal user bases</a>. He’s known CEO Dylan Field for over a decade. The Adobe deal shows “how much existing legacy companies really appreciate the power of these new businesses,” Kothari said. </p><p>Kothari has been through acquisitions twice, with LinkedIn buying his content platform Pulse, and then Microsoft buying LinkedIn. Kothari said it’s not in the cards for Notion, at least not right now. </p><p>“When [Notion CEO] Ivan was recruiting me, he said, do you want to work at Microsoft or do you want to build the next Microsoft?” Kothari said. “I’m personally excited about continuing to build here and seeing if we can continue to remain independent.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Securing the enterprise https://www.protocol.com/manuals/securing-the-enterprise/ Mon, 03 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

Another 23% have too thin a credit file to score or no file at all. That puts them in a credit trap: To build credit, these consumers need someone to give them a line of credit with which they can demonstrate good financial habits. But with scores that low, few lenders are prepared to offer them anything. </p><p>Neobanks say they can solve the problem through a new twist on secured credit cards. But regulators are already scrutinizing their offerings.</p><p>Secured credit cards have been an answer to the thin-credit problem <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/build-credit-with-secured-credit-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for decades</a> because they allow subprime borrowers to open a line of credit when they otherwise can’t by depositing cash upfront. That sum determines the borrower’s credit limit, and gives the banks collateral to hold on to in case of default. However, most require several hundred dollars as a deposit and impose <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp#:~:text=Secured%20credit%20cards%20generally%20come,lower%2Dcost%20forms%20of%20credit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty interest rates and fees</a>, which low-income borrowers struggle to afford.</p><h3>Payback time?</h3><p>Neobanks say they can avoid those problems and still help users build credit through secured credit cards that allow customers to repay their credit balance directly using their deposited cash, rather than keeping that money set aside. The products allow customers to build credit while paying for everyday expenses, neobanks say, without having to save up extra cash first. </p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank describe it as a win-win for consumers and fintechs — consumers can raise their credit scores, and the neobanks earn loyal customers. </p><p>But some in the industry see red flags. “They are, functionally, prepaid credit cards,” fintech analyst Alex Johnson told Protocol. That raises the concern that neobanks may be helping users increase their credit score with a tool that doesn't actually indicate their ability to repay. “If I was a lender, I’d be pissed about having to untangle the trade lines in these consumers’ credit files in order to make sure I wasn’t mistakenly granting credit to high-risk applicants.”</p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards each have similar mechanics: First, a user moves money from a checking account into a separate credit-builder account. The amount of money they move determines their credit limit: If a user moves $200 into the credit-builder account, they can spend up to $200 on a linked secured credit card. Then, at the end of the payment period, users can pay off their credit card balances with the money they’ve deposited — in this example, that same $200. Both Varo and Chime also allow users to sign up for automatic payments. </p><p>Varo and GO2bank told Protocol that it’s that third step — having to pay off the credit card at the end of the payment period — that makes the cards credit cards, not prepaid debit cards. Late payment or failure to repay can damage users’ credit scores. GO2bank additionally charges up to $39 for a late payment. Chime declined to answer any questions for this story. </p><p>With this distinction, neobanks are subject to regulations that govern credit but not debit cards, like the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_truth-in-lending-act.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth in Lending Act</a>. They also, crucially, can market the cards as credit-building tools. The companies make 1% to 2% more in interchange on credit cards than they do on debit cards, <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-marshall-introduce-bipartisan-credit-card-competition-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though pending legislation</a> may curb these fees.</p><p>Visa, on whose network Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards are issued, did not respond to questions about whether the cards resemble prepaid debit cards. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion also did not respond to questions about whether the cards accurately indicate customers’ ability to repay. </p><p>Varo and Go2Bank both say they are not worried about pending legislation changing the amount they can charge on interchange because the credit-building products are not a core source of profit. Rather, representatives of both banks told Protocol the product serves to help them meet customer needs and thus build goodwill with their users. “We’re building deeper connections and deeper engagement,” Raktim Mitra, Varo’s head of credit cards, told Protocol. </p><p>The CFPB acknowledged Varo and Chime’s secured credit-builder products in its <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-credit-card-market-report_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Consumer Credit Card Market Report</a>, without mentioning whether the products might deserve further scrutiny. When Protocol asked the bureau for an update on its views, a spokesperson said that “the CFPB is aware of this market development, and we are monitoring this issue closely.” </p><h3>A spot of ambiguity</h3><p>For consumer advocates, the ambiguity around such programs is a symptom of a larger problem: The CFPB has yet to bring neobanks fully under its regulatory purview. Under the law that created it, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-examinations/institutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bureau can supervise</a> financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets and certain participants in consumer financial markets, like those that work in consumer reporting, debt collection, or the servicing of some loans. </p><p>The bureau invoked a dormant authority to investigate nonbank fintechs in April of this year, though consumer advocates <a href="https://consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFPB-CFA%20Fact-Sheet-CFPB-and-non-banks.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been advocating</a> for more regular and thorough supervision. “There’s no accountability as of right now,” said Rachel Gittleman, head of financial services outreach at the Consumer Federation of America. </p><p>Gittleman’s primary concern with the credit-builders is that consumers may not understand they are using a lending product, despite the terms and conditions laid out in fine print. Though Chime, Varo, and GO2bank each market their products explicitly as secured credit cards, they <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/varo-bank-introduces-varo-believe-a-new-and-better-way-for-millions-of-americans-to-build-credit-301235475.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downplay</a> possible negative impacts on a customer’s credit, and automatic payment options make the products feel more like a regular debit card that doesn’t have default risk.

Today, we’re learning the best ways to source talent on LinkedIn — especially if you’re short on time and resources (read: recruiters). Plus, we’re reading Elon’s text messages from Larry Ellison, Jason Calicanis, and Joe Rogan.</em></p><p class=""><em>— Allison Levitsky, reporter (</em><a href="mailto:alevitsky@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Levitskyyy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>LinkedIn recruiting secrets</h3><br/><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/technology/meta-hiring-freeze.html" target="_blank">Meta</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/27/lyft-freezes-all-us-hiring-amid-stock-slump-economic-downturn/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> have stopped hiring for the year, and that’s music to the ears of other tech companies that are still staffing up. Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p>
<p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><h3>'Haha cool'</h3><br/><p>The world got a glimpse into Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" target="_blank">text inbox</a> this week thanks to his ongoing legal battle with Twitter. Now we know what tech’s power brokers really want: for Twitter to be an “open source protocol” rather than a company (Jack Dorsey), for Musk to move Twitter’s headquarters to Austin and force employees back to the office (Jason Calacanis), and a 24-hour edit button (Gayle King).</p>
<p>Larry Ellison, Reid Hoffman, and Joe Rogan are in there, too. </p>

So what’s next? According to Miller, the next era, including the rivalry between the U.S. and China, is all about computing power.</p><p>That tech rivalry and the story of how the chip industry got from four to 11.8 billion transistors are all part of Miller’s book, “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” which comes out Oct. 4. “Chip War” outlines the nature of the coming battle over semiconductors, showing how the power to produce leading-edge chips fell into the hands of just five companies: three from the U.S., one from Japan, and one from the Netherlands. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Miller touched on the evolving military uses of semiconductors, Russia’s chip procurement problems, and whether onshoring chips won’t necessarily increase the likelihood of a conflict between the U.S. and China. </p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>You write about how the Persian Gulf War became a pivotal moment for understanding the role microchips would play in warfare, especially with guided missiles. Are missiles still the use-case where the military needs the most advanced chips, or has that shifted to other areas like artificial intelligence or cyber attacks?</strong></p><p>I wouldn't necessarily think about individual weapon systems. Chips are important in those weapon systems, but there's also the broader integration of sensors to decision-makers, communication technologies, [and] weapon systems — all of which rely on chips of different sorts. </p><p>So it's the integration that matters as much as the capabilities of any individual system. But as more and more systems start to become more autonomous, the demands for computing power, memory, and communication bandwidth increase on all of these systems. </p><p>So yes, semiconductors are still very important in terms of advances in specific types of munitions, but it's also [about] the ability to integrate them, to transfer information between them, and to have them working together — and all that requires advanced semiconductors at every stage of the process. Militaries are confronting semiconductors everywhere they turn, and their ability to access the right types of semiconductors and more advanced chips is crucial for every aspect of the modern battlefield.</p><p><strong>What’s Russia’s status with the ability to procure semiconductors? There were reports that Russia was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-chips-are-down-russia-hunts-western-parts-to-run-its-war-machines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggling to access</a> chips for the Ukraine conflict. </strong></p><p>Russia does have some domestic chipmaking capacity but it's very, very limited, both in terms of the level of advancement — which is not that advanced — but also in terms of capacity. </p><p>What we've learned from the war — which confirms what we presumed before the war — is that, when you take apart the Russian military system, you'll find lots of foreign-produced chips, and often American-produced chips, inside. Many of these chips are off the shelf — things that you can acquire commercially.</p><p>In some ways, the fact that every military in the world is trying to use commercial chips in their systems has been an equalizing factor. But for Russia, it has presented some challenges too. Russia never really knows whether the chips it's buying have been sabotaged in any way. Every country has that to a certain extent. But the U.S., for example, is relying on chip fabs in the U.S. or in friendly countries — whereas Russia is relying almost exclusively on chips produced in unfriendly countries.</p><p>The systems integration capabilities are also lacking in Russia. They've got some, but there's just a lot more expertise in places like the U.S. or in East Asian countries [for] how you bring different types of chips plus software plus the hardware all together in a coherent system. And I think that's also somewhere we've seen Russia face some difficulties.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo courtesy of Chris Miller</small></p><p><strong>How successful do you think the Chips Plus Act will be? </strong></p><p>There's a question about getting the most bang for our buck out of the Chips Act fund. I think there are ways we can get more or less lucky on that front. But I don't think there's really a serious argument that the Chips Act funding is not going to increase the amount of leading-edge chipmaking capacity in the U.S. We've already seen a number of new facilities being built on the expectations of those funds.</p><p><strong>Does onshoring chip production increase the chances of conflict between the U.S. and China? It seems the U.S. is onshoring production in anticipation of greater conflict, but is it also possible it increases the chances of something happening by reducing the cost of conflict?</strong></p><p>This sort of mutually assured economic destruction thesis — the idea that the U.S. and China or China and Taiwan could never find themselves in a conflict because it would be too costly to do — I think history provides many examples of times in which economically integrated countries ended up in conflict. So that's one reason to be skeptical of it.</p><p>The second reason is that the assumption that was true for most of the period from Deng Xiaoping forward in China — that Chinese leaders were primarily focused on maximizing GDP — that assumption is no longer valid. The last three years of Chinese policy have not been about maximizing GDP but about political goals and zero COVID. It doesn't mean that they're not going to care at all about economic issues. But we shouldn't assume that either China or the U.S. or Taiwan is approaching these issues solely from the perspective of making sure trading continues unharmed.</p><p>The lesson of 2022 is not that economically integrated powers can't quickly decouple, because we've seen that in a shocking way between Russia and Europe. So I don't think we should take much comfort in the fact that there's a lot of economic integration between China, Taiwan, the U.S., and other countries in the sense that is going to guarantee a peaceful outcome. I don't think history suggests that's true.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Big Tech’s facade is crumbling https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/hiring-freeze-downturn-big-tech Sun, 02 Oct 2022 10:00:00 +0000

As part of this, we occasionally reprioritize the roles we need to fill and offer similar roles to candidates with pending offers,” the company told Protocol in an emailed statement. </li><li>Privately, sources say the environment has changed noticeably across the company, with a clear focus on cost-cutting. </li><li>And Amazon isn’t alone.

Yes, there were respectable amenities, like big cafeterias and workout centers. But employees weren’t getting massages, napping in pods, or swilling Kombucha on tap. </li><li>Then Silicon Valley came along and changed the paradigm. The can-do, entrepreneurial vibe was matched with enviable perks that helped make a job in tech the decade’s hottest LinkedIn accessory. </li></ul><p><strong>Now, industry leaders are left to grapple with the beast they created. </strong>And it’s somehow a surprise to them that after decades of insane perks, employees are <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/anti-perks-benefits-corporate-culture" target="_self">pushing back</a> on efforts to curtail those benefits. </p><ul><li>“‘We shouldn’t always equate fun with money,” Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-infamously told employees</a>.

It’s officially spooky season.</em></p><p><em>This week in the startup world: VCs rethink the office, inside the Twitter deal-making, and Cloudflare tries to woo startups.</em></p><h3>VCs rethink where — and what — their office spaces are </h3><br/><p>In the pre-pandemic times, Contrary’s network of venture scouts, founders, and top technologists reflected the magnetic pull Silicon Valley had on the tech industry. About 80% were based in the Bay Area, with a smattering living elsewhere. Today, when Contrary asked where people in its network were living, the split had changed with 40% in the Bay Area and another 40% living in or planning to move to New York.</p><p>It’s totally bifurcated now, said Contrary’s founder Eric Tarczynski. “That was a big wake-up call for us. Before the pandemic, New York wasn’t even really on the road map,” Tarczynski said. “A huge cross-section of engineers are now in New York.”</p><p><strong>Sand Hill Road is losing its shine as more VCs rethink where they’re located. </strong>That’s not to say the Bay Area is over (I’d argue far from it). But cities like New York are still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/09/every-firm-is-talking-about-it-venture-capital-is-having-its-new-york-moment/?sh=5f6b0e487fa3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“having their moment”</a> and continue to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2022-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grow in share of venture deals</a> over the Bay Area. </p><ul><li>In the last year, venture firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed have added offices in New York City. </li><li>Check-writing partners for Greylock and Threshold VC moved to NYC, while other firms have stealthily set up shop with small teams working out of WeWorks. Even the reporters covering Silicon Valley <a href="https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1574490494918443042" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are moving to NYC</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>There’s another strategy change afoot. </strong>More venture firms are experimenting with building community spaces instead of more offices for their partners to work out of. </p><ul><li>In New York, Tarczynski’s venture firm built Contrary NYC, a space that’s meant to be like <a href="https://www.protocol.com/contrary-nyc-founder-space" target="_self">a Soho House for techies</a> (minus the pool, restaurants, and hotel rooms). It’s supposed to evoke the feel of a club where engineers and entrepreneurs can hang out together, have a space to work, and host events for people in tech. In the last few weeks, there have been female founder dinners, comedy shows, and an appearance by Serena Williams at a launch party for startup Parfait held at Contrary NYC. </li><li>In Los Angeles, Brianne Kimmel’s Worklife fund opened up its new <a href="https://www.worklife.vc/studios/silverlake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worklife Studios</a> space in the Silver Lake neighborhood. She advertises the space as a location where “Discords and DAOs can host events, remote workers can meet new people, and anyone can enjoy our eclectic schedule of gatherings — from dinner parties with the neighborhood to album listening parties with artists.” This past weekend, a thousand people <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1573382493616877569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were waiting in line</a> to get into its space: The band Wallows was doing a pop-up merch store.</li></ul><strong>Part of it is finding a tribe outside of Silicon Valley. </strong>In SF, it can be frustratingly homogenous with many people working in and around the tech industry. In NY and LA, there’s more diversity and with that more opportunity for VCs to step in and be that beacon for the tech communities in a way that’s not as needed in a market like the Bay Area. “For the past 20 or 30 years, SF was the only game in town,” Tarczynski said. “Having a little bit more distribution and even talent flow is frankly pretty good for the venture community.”<h3>Overheard</h3><br/><p><strong>“This makes it seem like I’m desperate. Please stop,” </strong>Elon Musk texted angel investor Jason Calacanis over his promotion of an SPV to buy Twitter shares. Court filings filled with Elon Musk’s texts this week showed the fascinating network of relationships and power brokers that surround Musk in this deal — and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players" style="" target="_self">the things that they’re angling for</a>. Steve Jurvetson suggested Emil Michael for the job of CEO, but Musk shot it down in favor of someone with actual software experience. Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman both signed off to invest billions via text. Calacanis had the most interesting relationship with Musk, sending off ideas about charging people, forcing employees back to the office, and even throwing his name in the ring for CEO. Musk asked if he wanted to be an adviser, and Calacanis replied “Board member, advisor, whatever.” “[Y]ou have my sword.” That tone changed later on when Musk appeared miffed at Calacanis after Morgan Stanley and Musk employee Jared Birchall were “very upset” with the way Calacanis was running the deal and that he was taking advantage of his friendship with Musk. “Only ever want to support you,” Calacanis replied <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">in the texts</a>. </p><p><strong></strong><strong>“Some of the business practices don’t rise to the level of ethics that we’re all used to in private equity with your investors and your customers and your community, and that has been a bit disappointing,”</strong> said Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo in a rebuke of the crypto industry. After buying shares in FTX and a handful of other crypto companies, the private equity billionaire <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c5dd6c35-d3e2-4602-a8e4-54266990cfd3?tpcc=nltermsheet" target="_blank">told the FT</a> that he’s backing off investing in the crypto market for now despite remaining long-term bullish on the sector.</p><strong>“When my friend asks if I want to invest, of course I’m going to kick in $10,000 — it’s a way to stay connected, an excuse to get updates,” </strong>an anonymous startup founder <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/silicon-valley-turns-angel-investing-into-a-social-currency" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a>.

Gavin Newsom signed into law a <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20212022/SB1008/" target="_blank">bill</a> that makes phone calls from California’s prisons free of charge. The new law places the cost of calls not on incarcerated people — or the people receiving calls from them — but on the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p><p>California is the second state after Connecticut and the biggest state by far to institute such a law, which is a direct shot at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-cost-prison-communications-driving-debt-racial-wealth-gap-2021-6" target="_blank">$1.4 billion prison telecom industry</a>. For years prison telecom companies have maintained rates that “can be unjustly and unreasonably high, thereby impeding the ability of inmates and their loved ones to maintain vital connections,” the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-takes-next-big-steps-reducing-inmate-calling-rates" target="_blank">said</a> in 2020. </p><p>Prison reform advocates argue the new California law will have a hugely positive impact on the families of incarcerated people in California — and potentially other states that follow California's lead.  <span></span></p><hr/><p>"From a public policy perspective,  we should be wanting people to stay connected to their social networks, to their families, to be able to start looking for employment if they are close to getting out," said state Sen. Josh Becker, who sponsored the bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1008" target="_blank">SB 1008</a>. "But we have a very perverse system, which inhibits that and actually throws many families into debt."</p><p>For years, the high cost of prison phone calls has sapped money from low-income families with incarcerated loved ones. According to <a href="https://ellabakercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-Pays-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 report</a> by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, 34% of families go into debt in their attempt to maintain contact with loved ones inside through phone calls and visitations. The impact is disproportionately felt by women of color, because of the corresponding disproportionate number of men of color in America’s prisons.</p><p>Now, with the governor's blessing, "the simple cost of a call is never going to impair their ability to tell their children they love them or help their partner problem-solve a parenting situation,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a prison reform organization, which was a key player in advocating for the bill.</p><p>The new law covers the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2022/09/Tpop1d220928.pdf" target="_blank">93,000 incarcerated people</a> in the state's prison system, and Becker hopes future legislation will extend free calls into California's city and county jails, as well.</p><p>In addition to making calls free to users, the law prohibits local agencies from “receiving revenue for the provision of communication services to persons in its custody." The law also charges the state’s utility commission with ensuring service does not fall below standard, now that calls are free. Proponents of the law say the policy change will cost California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-23/prison-jail-communication-california-senate-bill-1008" target="_blank">about $12 million annually</a>, but that is a small fraction of the <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4517" target="_blank">$14.2 billion budget for the state’s corrections department</a>.</p><p>In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has tried to clamp down on the astronomical costs charged by prison telecom providers including slashing fees and capping rates at 21 cents per minute for interstate calls in 2013. More recently, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-improved-communications-access-incarcerated-people" target="_blank">adopted</a> a rule to prevent prison phone companies from seizing pre-paid funds from users, after one prison telecom giant, GTL, was found to have <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/fcc-gtl" target="_blank">seized</a> $121 million in customer funds. Other local governments have notched their own victories in the fight against sky-high prison call rates. In 2019, New York became the first major city jail system to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/connecticut-free-prison-phone-calls-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">make calls free</a>. In 2020, San Francisco also made phone calls from its jails free and <a href="https://sfgov.org/financialjustice/newsletters/san-francisco-announces-all-phone-calls-county-jails-are-now-free" target="_blank">announced a policy change</a> that would "permanently stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families through phone calls."</p><p>But advocates are hopeful that California's law will set an example for other state governments, because of the sheer size of its prison population. “California has a much bigger system,  and what it does matters to the rest of the corrections community,” Tylek said. “It will be a huge trendsetter for everyone else.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Great products come from strong patents https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/great-products-are-built-on-strong-patents Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000

</p><p>In today’s knowledge-based economy, IP rights play a foundational role. “Core R&D is the first step in getting good products into people’s hands,” said John Smee, senior VP of engineering and global head of wireless research at Qualcomm.<em> “</em>Everything from smartphones to the Internet of Things, automotive and industrial innovation begins as a breakthrough within our research labs.” At Qualcomm, Smee said, strong IP laws help the company confidently conduct cutting-edge 5G and 6G wireless research that will make its way into products ranging from everyday consumer goods to the factory floor. </p><p>Semiconductor companies, in particular, are fiercely protective of their IP because it’s their primary competitive advantage. Chip companies go to extraordinary lengths to protect their IP by maintaining black boxes only accessible to one person per fab, choosing highly secure operating locations, and keeping R&D teams separate from fab operations teams.</p><p>On the legal side, America’s Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 bestows legal protection of chip topography and design layout IP while the EU’s Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products of 1986 protects IC design. These regulations “have encouraged firms to continue to innovate,” according to the findings of Qualcomm’s and Accenture’s report, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6108671984&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harnessing the power of the semiconductor value chain</a>.Having a high-quality patent portfolio also helps companies build out their ecosystem, should they choose to license, through advising, training, support for launches, assistance in expanding to new markets, and much more.</p><p>Licensing democratizes innovation and invention— it makes the cutting-edge IP developed by one firm accessible to a broad range of others. As such, it allows other companies to skip the R&D step and jump right into building on the innovator’s foundation. This lowers the barrier to entry for upstart companies while providing a steady return on investments for the companies who have the resources to dedicate to heavy R&D.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><strong>An outsize economic impact</strong></p><p>IP protection also has an outsized impact on the US economy and helps create good higher-paying jobs. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105345571&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A report from The United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) found that in 2019 industries that intensively use IP protection account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (or about $7.8 trillion) and employ one-third of the total workforce — that’s 47.2 million jobs. In 2019, the average weekly earnings of $1,517 for workers across all IP-intensive industries was 60% higher than weekly earnings for workers in other industries.</p><p>Workers in IP-intensive industries were more likely to earn higher wages as well as participate in employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement plans, the USPTO report found.</p><p> But patent laws are often subject to much debate — one person’s idea of protection is another’s view of monopoly. That’s where organizations like <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105346519&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeadershIP</a> come into play. The group brings together experts on IP and innovation to debate issues at the intersection of research, policy, and industry.</p><p>In addition, several efforts are underway to help inventors get their ideas into the marketplace. The Inventors Patent Academy (TIPA), for instance, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent. TIPA has designed its program to make patenting more accessible and understandable for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQIA, lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Closing these gaps would promote U.S. job creation, entrepreneurial activity, economic growth, and global leadership in innovation. Estimates suggest that increasing participation by underrepresented groups in invention and patenting would quadruple the number of American inventors and increase the annual U.S. gross domestic product <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6106154609&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">by nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>If we want our nation’s rich history of innovation to continue, experts say, we must create an IP protection ecosystem that helps ensure that tech innovation will thrive.</p><p>“With the protection of patents,” Smee said, “there is no limit to where our creativity can take us.”</p>

<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/titus-welliver-as-harry-bosch-in-freevee-s-bosch-legacy-holding-a-flashlight.jpg?id=31860744&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C36%2C0%2C371"/><br/><br/><p>Amazon’s streaming efforts have long been all about Prime Video. So the company caught pundits by surprise when, in early 2019, it launched a stand-alone ad-supported streaming service called IMDb Freedive, with Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/amazons-imdb-launches-a-free-streaming-service-freedive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the move</a> “a bit odd.”</p><p>Nearly four years and two rebrandings later, Amazon’s ad-supported video efforts appear to be flourishing. Viewership of the service <a href="https://videoweek.com/2021/09/23/imdb-tv-is-quietly-becoming-an-avod-juggernaut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew by 138%</a> from 2020 to 2021, according to Amazon. The company declined to share any updated performance data on the service, which is now called Freevee, but a spokesperson told Protocol the performance of originals in particular “exceeded expectations,” leading Amazon to increase investments into original content by 70% year-over-year.</p><p>Key to Freevee’s success has been its deep integration with Prime Video and Fire TV, where it lives alongside ad-free subscription fare, pay-as-you-go rentals, and third-party subscription channels. Now Amazon is looking to broaden its international reach.</p><p>“I'm very excited about the possibility of an ad-supported service in front of the paywall in many countries,” said Ryan Pirozzi, who has been working on Amazon’s video strategy for over a decade and became head of Freevee in August.</p><h3>IMDb TV was not standing out</h3><p>When Amazon first launched its free video service, it was looking to capitalize on the IMDb brand it has owned since 1998. “Our early thinking was, people recognize that brand,” said Pirozzi. However, the branding didn’t exactly catch on with consumers, in part because IMDb was best known as a database for industry professionals. </p><p>Changing the service’s name to IMDb TV did little to solve those issues, which is why the company ultimately switched to the Freevee brand in April of this year. “IMDb TV wasn’t standing out as much as Freevee is,” Pirozzi said. “Personally, I’m very happy we rebranded.”</p><p>Third-party data suggests the rebrand is working: The service’s mobile apps generated about as many downloads since the rebrand as it did during the years preceding it, according to estimates by app intelligence company Sensor Tower. For the five months following the rebrand, downloads were up 113% compared to the preceding five months.</p><p>The total number of installs of the Freevee mobile app is still fairly small, with Sensor Tower estimating the app  has been downloaded 3.3 million times from Google Play and the App Store, while Google’s own data puts the number of downloads from Google Play between 5 and 10 million.</p><p>The service is closely integrated with Prime Video, where its movies and shows are being presented as “free with ads.” Mixing subscription-exclusive content with free, ad-supported videos <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/smart-tvs-content-first" target="_self">can be confusing to consumers</a>, but Pirozzi argued that it was a trade-off for being able to offer more choices, which also includes access to pay-as-you-go movie rentals. </p><p>“We have to work on eliminating any confusion,” he said, adding that Freevee was growing both as a stand-alone service and within Prime Video. “I think people are getting it. Our best SVOD customers are our best TVOD customers [and are also] our most engaged AVOD customers.”<br/></p><h3>Uncertain times for streaming</h3><p>The ascent of Freevee happens as the entire streaming industry is rediscovering free, ad-supported video. Fox has plans to turn its free Tubi streaming service into a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/tubi-will-become-a-billion-dollar-business-foxs-lachlan-murdoch-says" target="_blank">billion-dollar business</a>; Viacom’s Pluto TV reached that same milestone <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>. Even Netflix, which long resisted advertising, is <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-microsoft-ads-partners" target="_self">getting ready to launch an ad-supported tier</a>. </p><p>At the same time, there are some signs that parts of the industry are slowing their investments into originals in light of a more challenging economic climate. Warner Bros. Discovery, for instance, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-strategy?rebelltitem=1" target="_self">canceled several projects for HBO Max recently</a>. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9">

</p><p>“I guess I must have missed the memo,” Pirozzi retorted, pointing to the fact that Freevee’s investments into originals have increased by 70%. Some of the originals running in the service include “Bosch: Legacy,” a spin-off of the police procedural “Bosch” that ran on Prime Video for seven seasons; “Judy Justice,” a remake of “Judge Judy”; and ex-con comedy “Sprung.”</p><p>These shows may not pay for themselves, but they do work to attract new audiences. “Originals and pay-window movies are a customer acquisition driver,” Pirozzi said. “Then we drive depth of engagement with licensed content, deeper catalog, and linear channels. That model has been working for us, and we see big uplifts in our business when we launch something like a ‘Bosch: Legacy.’”</p><p>Many of these originals are also being repurposed for linear free ad-supported streaming channels, also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/plex-live-tv-linear-streaming" target="_self">known as FAST channels among industry insiders</a>. “This rise of FAST linear channels is so fascinating,” Pirozzi said. “To some people, it’s sort of retro. It’s in a linear format without pause or fast forward. But that’s really growing and working for us.”</p><p>Freevee’s more than 100 free linear channels are closely integrated with Amazon’s Fire TV platform, where they are presented as part of the live TV tab. The linear format also allows Amazon to carry some content that it would otherwise not have the rights to, Pirozzi explained. “‘Kim’s Convenience,’ one of my favorite shows on Netflix, is not available to license on demand,” he said. However, Amazon was able to license the show as a linear channel, which it now streams to Freevee viewers.<br/>Freevee debuted in Germany in August after expanding to the U.K. last year. Now, the service is looking to jump into new territories.</p><p>“We have greater international expansion plans,” Pirozzi said. He declined to share Amazon’s exact road map, but suggested that there may be opportunities in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Asia, among others.<br/></p><p>“There are so many places where the value proposition of an ad-supported video product will be very popular with customers,” he said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Biden’s AI Bill of Rights shoots for the stars.

Today we look at the AI Bill of Rights from the White House and how it fits into the existing privacy push by Congress. As you have likely already heard, the Twitter deal is back on. Also, Micron plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in a New York state chip factory thanks to the Chips-Plus package.</em></p><h3>Pie in the sk(AI)</h3><br/><p>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday unveiled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. The document is lofty and well intended, but not particularly practical in the near term — nor to the liking of some AI watchdogs, as Protocol’s Kate Kaye <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights" target="_self">pointed out</a>.</p><ul><li>The white paper sketches out five standards that will help ensure automated systems don’t infringe on our rights: protection from unsafe systems, equitable/nondiscriminatory algorithms, agency over our data, transparency over automated systems, and access to opt-outs and remedies. </li><li>(Sorry, if you were expecting a <a href="https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1577367260510924802?s=20&t=QfFlXeQ5cbsQuosM0y4wog" target="_blank">manifesto on the rights of sentient robots</a>, look elsewhere.) </li></ul><p><strong>The OSTP is careful to emphasize that it’s only intended to support the development of official policies.</strong> In other words, the AI Bill of Rights has as much legal authority as this newsletter. Still, it’s useful in that it represents a sort of regulatory wish list for the Biden administration. </p><ul><li>To be fair, the OSTP includes a lot of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-enterprise/white-house-ai-samsung-chips?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">precise, prescriptive guidance</a> for corporations. The infeasibility doesn’t come from the lack of specific guidance, then, but from the fact that corporations are unlikely to respond unless compelled by the government. </li><li>Some of the guidance is also so disruptive to the status quo that it would remake entire industries. For example, the AI Bill of Rights advises that “you should be able to opt out from automated systems in favor of a human alternative.” But there simply <em>aren’t</em> human alternatives at scale for much of what we do on the internet.</li></ul><p><strong>Sometimes the OSTP doesn’t even seem sure of its own recommendations.</strong> For example, the bill of rights calls for unchecked surveillance to be avoided unless “strictly necessary” but then goes on to say national security agencies should only abide by these guidelines “where feasible.” So, you know … restaurants should never charge extra for guac, but Chipotle can do so “when convenient.” </p><p><strong>These feasibility challenges persist in the prescriptions for the private sector.</strong> </p><ul><li>The OSTP calls for the timely removal of user data from machine learning systems trained with that data. But as I’ve <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/pipelines-data-privacy-design" target="_self">noted before</a>, companies often have no idea where user data flows within their own data pipelines. This complexity likely makes it impossible to comply with existing privacy laws, including the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a>. </li><li>The OSTP also tells companies they should be doing “proactive equity assessments” while also not tracking or using proxies for demographic features. How do you verify lack of bias against a demographic while also ensuring you can’t track it? </li></ul><p><strong>The bill of rights goes above and beyond the primary federal bill under consideration — and that may be its greatest strength. </strong>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text#H88DA5D95E892448B9DDA6F37E0106E77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a> is a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/privacy-draft-2022" target="_self">big deal</a>, even if it suffers from a significant <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/privacy-preemption-adppa?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">preemption problem</a>. But next to the AI Bill of Rights, it looks somewhat unambitious: </p><ul><li>There’s overlap in the sense that both the ADPPA and the AI Bill of Rights say Americans should be able to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/federal-privacy-law-introduced?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">request</a> their information, request that it be deleted, and tell companies to change personal information when it’s not accurate.</li><li>But the bill of rights <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/#privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes</a> many more ambitious privacy goals, including more rigorous consent standards for obtaining user data and better data protections in sensitive user domains such as health care and education. </li><li>The ambiguity and idealism in the AI Bill of Rights can be criticized as its greatest weakness, but in some sense they are its greatest strength: The document shows the federal government is at least thinking of privacy in a much more ambitious way than the bills in Congress would let on. </li></ul><p>The OSTP shot for the stars. Congress is still on the ground building a privacy foundation. That combination in itself can be a great thing. But if ADPPA ends up not passing, what use do we have for a starry-eyed bill of rights? </p><em>— Hirsh Chitkara (</em><a href="mailto:hchitkara@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/hirshchitkara" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em><h3>In Washington</h3><br/><p><strong>The Twitter <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">deal</a></strong><strong> is back on … probably.</strong> Elon Musk on Tuesday sent a letter to Twitter saying he’d buy the company at his original offered price of $54.20 per share.

One area that’s being built out is crypto trading as a service, with APIs and other products that developers and companies can use to set up crypto trading for their clients. </p><p>The latest sign of this maturation is EDX Markets, a new exchange for digital assets that’s being developed by Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab, as well as venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm.</p><p>The digital exchange, headed by former Citadel Securities executive Jamil Nazarali, is roughly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-and-others-start-crypto-exchange-edx-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeled</a> on and built on the trading technology of Members Exchange, or MEMX, another exchange that’s being developed by similar companies as an alternative to large stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq.</p><p>EDXM’s custody and wallet technology is being provided by crypto custody and infrastructure company Paxos, the companies announced Wednesday</p><p>Paxos, which is a custodian regulated by New York state, holds customer accounts in fully segregated accounts and has signed up large consumer-facing clients to enable crypto trading. Its customers include PayPal, broker dealers such as Interactive Brokers, and others such as Nubank and Mastercard. Paxos has a conditional bank trust charter from the <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCC</a> and says it expects its chartered entity, Paxos National Trust, to open later this quarter.</p><p>Up until now big banks haven’t moved heavily into crypto because of accounting, risk, security, and regulatory concerns, as well as requirements by the Federal Reserve and a desire for more mature technology, said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “We still haven't seen any of the big bank holding companies in the U.S. bring one of these offerings to market,” he added.</p><p>EDXM, with its leadership and backing from Wall Street firms, could attract large banks into digital assets, he said. EDXM is “bringing traditional market structure and also traditional market participants to this liquidity offering through the exchange that is going to be really built to support and attract these types of bank holding companies and brokerages,” Hessert said. For example, EDXM plans to offer delivery settlement versus payment <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/172104/edx-markets-ceo-vows-to-learn-from-travails-at-rival-institutional-crypto-exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settlement</a>, a settlement method that’s used in traditional securities trading. </p><p>EDXM is also different from some other crypto providers that are the market maker, exchange, and custodian all in one, which can be a conflict of interest and is typically not done in traditional markets, Hessert said.</p><p>More large liquidity pools such as EDXM will also increase transparency for the crypto market, Hessert said. Presently, crypto markets can be opaque, with large spreads and high volatility.</p><p>The competition to provide crypto trading, custody, security, and related technology for large institutions is intense. The resulting consolidation wave isn’t without some hiccups: Wyre canceled its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/bolt-axes-15b-deal-to-buy-crypto-infrastructure-provider-wyre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal</a> to be acquired by Bolt for $1.5 billion last month. But more deals could soon come in this sector, since numerous providers offer overlapping services, analysts say. </p><p>Coinbase provides crypto trading APIs, custody, payments API, and related services, seeking to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/coinbase-cloud-node" target="_self">lure big and small</a> customers alike. Coinbase has three related APIs — a general-purpose one for trading, deposits, withdrawals, and tax reporting; another for streaming market data; and a specialized FIX API for sophisticated traders. Coinbase, which recently announced a deal with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/blackrock-to-offer-crypto-for-institutional-investors-through-coinbase-prime/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, has an advantage in routing orders to its own exchange or, for large customers using its Prime API, to other liquidity providers. </p><p>A number of other API providers like Prime Trust, MoonPay, Wyre, and Transak have emerged to offer quick and easy connections to crypto trading and other services, particularly for fintech and crypto developers building apps. Custody providers such as Anchorage and Fireblocks also offer crypto trading.

Too bad. https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/apple-app-store-price-hike Wed, 05 Oct 2022 11:15:09 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/apple-s-planned-price-hike-is-going-into-effect.png?id=31864079&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><strong>Good morning! </strong>Apple hiked App Store prices by around 20% in some markets outside the U.S. without any explanation and with barely any notice. Critics are unsurprisingly upset, but what choice do they have?</p><h3>It’s Apple’s party, and it’ll charge if it wants to</h3><br/><p>The App Store just became a little pricier for many non-U.S. customers. Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e1b1hcmv&1663640181" target="_blank">planned price hike</a> went into effect today for any market that uses the euro, in addition to Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In most markets, the price increase equates to about 20% higher costs for apps (though it’s even more in some countries, like Japan and South Korea). So a mobile app that was previously 0.99 euros now costs 1.19 euros, while the same is true for an in-app purchase like mobile game currency. Curiously, Apple isn’t saying why exactly, leaving developers to guess whether it’s due to currency fluctuations, the related global economic crisis, or perhaps rising energy costs related to operating the App Store overseas. </p>
<p><strong>The price hike is arriving at a sensitive time. </strong>The combination of record inflation and a looming global recession has started to take a serious toll on foreign markets as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/16/business/strong-dollar.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strength of the U.S. dollar continues to grow</a> relative to weakening foreign currencies like the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. </p><ul><li>While Apple has yet to raise prices in the U.S., it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/apple-raises-iphone-14-price-in-uk-japan-australia-overseas-markets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiked the price</a> of the new iPhone 14 lineup in Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K., in some cases by the equivalent of nearly $150. </li><li>A number of other consumer electronics companies, including PlayStation maker Sony, have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enacted similar hardware price hikes</a> in the EU and other markets in recent months. </li><li>Apple can certainly afford to weather any economic storms better than most, if not all, of its competitors. In its last earnings announcement from July, Apple said it had a record Q3 with $19.6 billion in services revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. </li><li>The company remains the most valuable in the world with a market cap of more than $2.3 trillion. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple critics are not pleased. </strong>Naturally, a price hike with little explanation and on such short notice is going to rankle Apple's usual detractors in the developer community, including Fortnite maker Epic Games. But the criticisms have grown especially pointed given the current economic climate. </p><ul><li>“These increases were made without the input or consent of app developers, which highlights the extent of Apple’s market power. In no other industry can a business single-handedly increase the prices of another business’s products,” <a href="https://appfairness.org/coalition-for-app-fairness-blog-on-apple-price-increases/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Rick VanMeter, the executive director for the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness, of which Epic, Match Group, and Spotify are members. </li><li>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had harsh words, too. “Imagine if a landlord told their small business tenant they had to increase their prices without any say in the matter or anywhere else to go,” he said in a statement yesterday. “That is what Apple is doing to developers for no other reason than to pad Apple’s bottom line.”</li><li>“Developers don't want to raise their app prices in the EU and UK. Consumers don't want app price increases in the EU and UK. Central banks fighting inflation don't want app price inflation,” Sweeney wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1577032444955746304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">follow-up tweet yesterday</a>. “But Apple is raising developers' prices against developers' wishes.” </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple is no stranger to sudden price increases. </strong>For decades, the iPhone maker has exercised near-total control of its software ecosystems, including the digital storefronts it has operated since the days of iTunes. </p>
<ul><li>You might remember when Apple infamously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/apple-begins-variable-pricing-on-itunes-store-some-songs-now-129-each/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the price</a> of newer, more popular MP3s on the iTunes Store from 99 cents to $1.29. The move, a concession to the music industry, helped <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/09/itunes_price_increases_mean_slower_sales_for_music_labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labels sell more albums</a> after years of complaints that the era of iTunes pushed consumers toward buying singles over albums. There was plenty of hand-wringing at the time, but nothing really changed. That is, until music streaming took off and individual song sales began to decline. </li></ul>
<p>But there is no comparable distribution change for mobile apps or the App Store on the horizon. Apple sets the rules for commerce on iOS, and everyone must follow — so long as they want to reach iPhone customers.<br/><br/><em>— Nick Statt</em><br/></p><h3>The Twitter drama has only just begun</h3><br><p>Elon Musk decided, seemingly out of nowhere, that he actually <em>will</em> buy Twitter. But before you assume the roller coaster ride is over, think again.</p>
<p><strong>Musk <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">sent a letter</a> to Twitter </strong>proposing to buy the company at the original, agreed-upon price of $54.20 a share provided the company agrees to forget the whole court battle. Twitter shares jumped on the news before exchanges halted trading.</p>
<ul><li>The news coincidentally broke at the same time Twitter employees were entering a long meeting about its 2023 strategy. Very funny, we know.</li><li>Twitter said it received Musk’s letter and intends to close the deal at the original price. It hasn’t addressed Musk’s proposal to end its lawsuit.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk and Twitter could be entering even muddier waters, </strong>where the company will transition to a whole new owner who has expressed rather controversial ideas about the service. What happens next could go like this, as described by Protocol Policy editor Kate Cox:</p><ul><li>Step one: Musk buys Twitter!</li><li>Step two: ???</li><li>Step three: Twitter reaches profitability under Musk.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk loves to prove the skeptics wrong, </strong>and turning Twitter around could be another way to do it. But those question marks are there for a reason: the details of how he would do it are beyond murky. </p><ul><li>How will Twitter employees — the ones who haven’t fled the company in droves as the acquisition moil unfolded, that is — react? </li><li>How will he handle the spam problem he cited as an excuse to walk away from the deal?</li><li>Musk offered one cryptic hint about his plans in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>: “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-elon-musk-buys-his-old-x-com-domain-from-paypal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reclaimed</a> the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, and has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1557199404301307904" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teased</a> the idea of building a Twitter competitor on it.</li></ul>There are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/twitter-lbo-revives-12-5-billion-headache-for-wall-street-banks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questions about the debt financing</a> needed to close the deal, and Musk and Twitter will have to thrash out what to do about the pending lawsuit. But if they can overcome those obstacles, Twitter will get a new owner and a different future. The one true thing we can say about both: They are completely unpredictable.<br/><br/><p><em>— Sarah Roach</em></p><h3>​The calm before the storm</h3><br><p>Hundreds of companies that cut staff in recent months announced major funding rounds just a few months before. But startups aren’t blowing through their funding weeks after the check is deposited; it’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/layoffs-funding-data" target="_self">more complicated than that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Startups often wait several months to a year </strong>after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public about it.</p><ul><li>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners, told Nat. </li><li>This is because founders often want to announce funding with other big news, like a product release or an executive hire. </li></ul>
<p><strong>The bigger an organization gets, </strong>the more secretive it becomes about funding updates. News of a big check is easier to keep from leaking publicly at a company of 100 compared to a company of 2,000, Alban said. </p><ul><li>Companies like Bolt, Getir, and Trade Republic caught flack for this very reason. Many employees said they felt betrayed, as funding announcements gave the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. </li><li>“Bolt employees were blind sided because the CEO was saying just weeks ago how everything is fine,” <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Bolt-just-layed-off-people-in-the-worst-way-possible-yL7QauTE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an anonymous user wrote on the message board Blind</a>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>To help ease the blow of layoffs, </strong>being transparent can go a long way. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Anthony Kline, a partner at VC firm The GP.<br/><br/><em>— Nat Rubio-Licht</em><br/></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM CAPITAL ONE SOFTWARE</h3><br><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="0b87547b908f01341fe8a968efb24080" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123932305&iu=/21901267728" id="b689f" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843120&width=980"/></a>Many business leaders aren’t sure where to begin when it comes to migrating to the cloud.

The legislation allowed some families to <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/taxact/file-for-less-and-get-more/understanding-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly double</a> their tax benefits per child, which was especially critical for low-income families, who disproportionately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/04/20/covid-19-pandemic-pinches-finances-of-americas-lower-and-middle-income-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bore the financial brunt</a> of the pandemic. </p><p>For Amanda Renteria, the <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/safety-net-innovation-lab-audacious-ted-talk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEO of Code for America</a>, the new legislation meant the work had only just begun. Renteria understood that making tax credits available is one thing, but helping families navigate bureaucracy to get them is another. Renteria also knew that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a nonprofit that helps the government use technology to better serve communities, could play a critical role in addressing that access problem. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Renteria explained how she made the decision to develop a proof of concept for an app that would help people claim the Child Tax Credit. Code for America developed this mock-up despite limited resources and no guarantee that it would be selected by the government as its technology partner. The leap of faith ended up paying off, and Code for America reported in May that it <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/code-for-america-getctc-portal-returns-for-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped</a> 115,000 families successfully claim the tax benefit throughout the 2021 tax filing season. </p><p><em>Renteria’s story, as told to Protocol, has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What we knew about the IRS, having worked with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program [last year], is just how hard it is for people to get through [the system to get benefits].</strong> With VITA, we helped create an online, mobile-friendly, simplified application that actually walks you through [the process] in both English and Spanish. </p><p><strong>When Child Tax Credit came up, we knew that this policy — though it passed and everyone was excited about it — would actually hit a wall. </strong>We had seen the barriers over time on much easier processes, like food assistance in some states. </p><p><strong>We knew filling out forms is extremely difficult.</strong> So there wasn't even a question of whether or not we could make this process better. Again, [this was] largely because we had been doing it for a while. We helped VITA sites go online the year before, and we could actually see how you improve throughput if you have a simplified process.</p><p><strong>The big question for us was whether we wanted to build it, knowing we weren't sure whether it would land. </strong>A lot of the question was how we bring the White House, the Treasury, and the IRS up to speed with our lessons learned. We are a small nonprofit. There were no guarantees that anyone would believe us — trust not only our data, but our ability to do it. </p><p><strong>We felt our need to jump in because we didn’t see it happening anywhere else. </strong>During that period of time, we were still in transition to a new administration, so we knew that the federal government was still building up its digital talent. The private sector was also focused on higher-end clients and how they were going to live in a new online world. Everything was changing during a pandemic, and the only way we were going to reach [families] was through their phones, and trying to be as simplified and trustworthy as possible.</p><p><strong>So in very short order, our engineering team put together a mock-up of what it would look like.</strong> [It showed] what the experience would be, how we would triage, how we would ensure that clients are being taken care of through chat. We were able to turn this around in a couple of weeks, but it was based on 10 years of research. We were really confident in our ability to create a front door that spoke to the clients we were trying to serve. We were less confident in whether or not it would be enough to show [the White House] what's possible.</p><p><strong>In a meeting with the White House and Treasury, we walked through the actual process someone would go through.</strong> Within that, not only did we build trust in terms of the relationship we already had, but the tangibility of seeing the vision of what was possible was a key difference for them. But that took some risk on our part — we had to build it before we knew whether it would actually be a relationship that could lead to the scale we have now proved to have.</p><p><div id="series-box"></div>

With the change, Parikh is now the sole chief executive of the privately held company, a prominent up-and-coming player in cloud security that last year achieved a valuation of $8.3 billion.</p><p>Lacework planned to inform employees of the change on Tuesday. Hatfield, who previously served as president at Pure Storage, leaves Lacework's executive leadership a few months shy of his second year with the company. </p><p>As part of the co-CEO model, Hatfield, who goes by the nickname "Hat," focused on business operations and expansion at Lacework, which has raised $1.85 billion in funding. Hatfield joined Lacework as CEO and chairman in early 2021. He could not immediately be reached Tuesday.</p><p>Parikh joined as co-CEO in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-lacework-jay-parikh" target="_blank">mid-2021</a>, and has focused on product and engineering for the company. The two have known each other for two decades, having previously worked at the same time at Akamai Technologies.</p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Parikh characterized the move as planned and amicable, prompted by conversations between "Hat, myself, and the board" that led to the conclusion that the co-CEO model was no longer the best fit for the company. Lacework's executive leadership and board have been "looking at where the business is and what it needs to get to the next level," and have determined that "unifying the company" under a single CEO made the most sense right now, Parikh said.</p><p>When it comes to Lacework's product and sales strategy and its relationships with customers, partners, and the big public cloud platforms, the move should help with "making sure that's all unified [around] one set of priorities with one focus," he said.</p><p>Parikh said he doesn't believe Hatfield has "any immediate plan to go jump into anything full-time anytime soon." Hatfield is "still going to be spending a good amount of time" on Lacework, Parikh told Protocol.<br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-right" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: right;">

</p><p>Founded in 2014, Lacework offers a "data-driven" service that aims to stand out in the fast-growing cloud security market by collecting and analyzing data from across a customer's cloud environments. The goal is to to provide customers with crucial security insights, such as which threats to prioritize for action, the company has said.</p><p>The company raised a $525 million funding round in January 2021, followed by an additional $1.3 billion in funding in November 2021 that brought with it the $8.3 billion valuation. Lacework touted that round as "the largest funding round in security industry history," and the company ranks at No. 3 in terms of the biggest valuations for privately held security companies, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank">CB Insights</a>.</p><p>Lacework is also notable for having been just the third company to be incubated out of Sutter Hill Ventures, following a model that was used to launch Pure Storage and Snowflake. The Lacework platform supports AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as Kubernetes environments. </p><p>In May, Lacework disclosed that it had laid off <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/lacework-layoffs-cloud-security-startup" target="_blank">20% of its staff</a>, in response to what the co-CEOs <a href="https://www.lacework.com/blog/lacework-update/" target="_blank">then described</a> as a "seismic shift" in "both the public and private markets." The company had previously <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/cybersecurity-has-53-unicorns-here-are-10-to-watch/" target="_blank">reported</a> having more than 1,000 employees as of March, and did not immediately have a figure available for its current employee count on Tuesday.</p><p>Prior to Lacework, Hatfield had previously spent nearly seven years as president at Pure Storage followed by 16 months as its vice chair, according to his LinkedIn. He joined the company as president in 2013, a few years into its founding, and stayed on through its initial public offering and its first several years as a public company.</p><p>While there are no plans to directly replace Hatfield at Lacework, given the unification of the CEO duties under Parikh's leadership, the company does plan to hire a chief revenue officer in the near future, Parikh said.</p><p>Ultimately, Lacework's leadership is focusing on making moves that will set it up "to be successful over 10, 20 years — we're not building this to be a transaction," Parikh said. <br/></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The future of pay transparency in tech https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/pay-transparency-in-tech-sb1162 Tue, 04 Oct 2022 22:07:11 +0000

We spoke with Susan Alban, operating partner and chief people officer at Renegade Partners, and compensation consultant Ashish Raina to learn how.</p><hr/><p><strong>Startups will adopt pay bands earlier.</strong> Five or 10 years ago, it wasn’t unusual for 50-person companies to be operating without a “career ladder” or “career architecture” with compensation bands for different job functions and levels, Alban said.</p><ul><li>Today’s tighter labor market — and demands from candidates — mean that companies structure their compensation bands sooner.</li><li>Because the new law applies to companies with just 15 employees, even tiny startups will be required to define their pay bands in a more structured way, Alban said.</li><li>“Which is a little funky when you have, like, eight people, to have a band for every single job, because sometimes you just have one person in a job,” she said. “It just nudges companies to be a little bit more thoughtful in defining what is the job, what is the relative seniority, and what would we reasonably pay relative to market-based pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>Companies may find other ways to differentiate pay in order to compete for the best talent. </strong>The law only requires companies to disclose base pay, not stock, bonuses, or benefits. </p><ul><li>This means bonuses and equity could become more important forms of compensation, which may shift the issue of unequal pay to other areas.</li><li>Bonuses “can be very arbitrary,” especially in early-stage companies where goals change all the time, Alban said.</li><li>They may prove to be even more important levers for attracting and retaining great employees, however. “Fair pay is not equal pay,” Raina said. “If someone is more proficient or more highly performing in a role, there should be a differentiation in pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>The law might provide a little more incentive for companies to hire outside of California, </strong>but not much. The law on its own is unlikely to have a major effect on where companies hire, but it adds more administrative headache to California employers.</p><ul><li>“I don’t hear employers talking about not wanting to hire in the state of Colorado because of these laws,” Alban said.</li><li>Some companies may choose to advertise jobs with a national labor rate that would overpay candidates in low-cost states like Mississippi but underpay Californians, Raina said.</li></ul><p><strong>Big companies are likely to comply more readily than startups.</strong> An online job search shows companies like Google, Salesforce, and Twitter listing pay ranges in ads. Some listings cite the Colorado law explicitly.</p><ul><li>“I think the general consensus among progressive technology employers is that this is the way the world is going,” Alban said. “Rather than fret about it and deviate from hiring in particular regions to avoid compliance, better to just comply anyway.”</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li>Some startups likely won’t comply with the law, Raina said. “They’re trying to survive,” he said. “Yes, this law exists, and yes, there’s going to be some risk if they don’t comply, but that isn’t necessarily people’s forefront of an issue.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The EU ushers in the USB-C era https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-apple-iphone-ewaste Tue, 04 Oct 2022 19:32:24 +0000

The mandate will extend to laptops in 2026. </p><p>The rule — which was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-charging-ewaste" target="_blank">introduced in June</a> — passed 602-13, while eight members abstaining from voting. That reflects an overwhelming desire to make the average person's life easier (goodbye, cluttered junk drawer) as well as cut down on pernicious e-waste. While the decision means that ports such as micro-USB will fall by the wayside, Apple's Lightning port is also slated to go the way of the dinosaur. </p><p>The company's iPad and various MacBooks rely on USB-C charging. But Apple has held steadfastly to the technology for the iPhone, rolling out its most recent iteration of the phone with a Lightning rather than a USB-C port. The iPhone was the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/31/european-smartphone-market-2021/" target="_blank">bestselling phone</a> in the EU last year, with Apple capturing 34% of the smartphone market.</p><p>The European Council needs to sign off on the legislation before it officially goes into law. But that prospect looks likely. After that, the clock to USB-C hegemony begins counting down. The timing could work out well for Apple at least; the company releases a new iPhone every year in September. With the mandate likely to take effect in fall 2024, it means next year's iPhone could well be the last one to feature a Lightning port — unless Apple decides to just get the switch over with, something the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066661/apple-iphone-15-drop-lightning-port-usb-c-2023-prediction-rumor" target="_blank">company is reportedly considering</a>. </p><p>The company could also make a USB-C version of the iPhone for the EU and a Lightning version for everyone else, of course, but that seems unlikely given the logistical hurdles. The iPhone could also go totally portless for charging, though that would be a much more radical leap. <br/></p><p>As written, the rule would allow electronics without a USB-C port to continue being sold as long as they are "placed on the market before the date of application," according to a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the vote. Regardless, if you're a Lightning stan, uh, you should consider snapping up an iPhone 14 sooner than later.</p><p>Cutting down on e-waste is a sneaky climate policy. The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Pages/Spotlight/Global-Ewaste-Monitor-2020.aspx" target="_blank">Global E-Waste Monitor</a> put out by the United Nations showed that nearly 54 million tons of e-waste piled up in 2020, a number that could rise to almost 75 million tons by the end of this decade. That's a local environmental concern given the toxic chemicals and components. But it's also a huge waste of emissions. More than two-thirds of the carbon pollution tied to electronics is emitted in the manufacturing process. </p><p>Cutting down on the number of charging cables produced (and trashed) is a relatively modest way to cut down on e-waste. Stronger policies that favor right-to-repair as well as companies working harder to stave off forced obsolescence could also offer a pathway to reduce the amount of electronic churn. Improving e-waste recycling is yet another avenue to cut down on trash; the Global E-Waste Monitor found only 17.4% of electronic trash is currently recycled. Apple and other tech companies have touted moving toward a circular economy as central to their sustainability goals. While the EU's USB-C mandate alone won't make that transition magically happen, it could spur further innovation and serve as a reminder of all the work that remains to be done.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Why $100 per ton is the carbon removal industry's holy grail https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-removal-cost-per-ton Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:03:51 +0000

It’s one of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/frontier-cdr-purchases-stripe-alphabet" target="_self">Frontier’s</a> stated criteria that the fund uses to evaluate its advance purchases. In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of the long-duration carbon removal community, CarbonPlan found that stakeholders are focused on the $100 benchmark. The Department of Energy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/climate/glasgow-carbon-removal-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even announced</a> that it would be investing in carbon removal research to bring the cost of the technology down to $100 per ton.</p><hr/><p><strong>Where did that number come from? </strong>In short, it’s the cost per ton of removal services that it would take for the CDR industry to reach commercial viability. It’s based on a handful of factors. </p><ul><li>It’s the point at which carbon removal becomes affordable at the scale needed to make it a meaningful tool to reach net zero (and, eventually, negative emissions), Shuchi Talati, a senior visiting scholar at Carbon180, told Protocol. </li><li>It evolved from modeling and policy conversations, and is aligned with other existing costs, like the European Union’s carbon price (which will likely reach that number in a decade). </li><li>It’s also tied to the social cost of carbon, a metric that measures the economic damage a ton of carbon emitted causes. Estimates of the social cost of carbon keep increasing as climate damages become clearer.</li><li>Another reason could be much simpler. The climate community could just be taking its cue from the DOE, anchoring its own targets to the agency’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Carbon Negative Shot target</a>, which was set for $100 per ton, CarbonPlan’s Danny Cullenward wrote in an email to Protocol.</li></ul><p><strong>So far, no one has come anywhere close to reaching that target. </strong>Currently, most carbon removal services cost well above $100 per ton, although the Inflation Reduction Act’s updated 45Q tax credit of up to $180 per ton for direct air capture could help some startups get closer to achieving that target. </p><p>“$100 per ton is an extremely ambitious 10-year target, likely probably more of a 15- to 20-year target,” Talati said. But she thinks it’s “important to be ambitious,” and “there’s a lot of momentum around CDR and getting these technologies to scale.”</p><p>The world could have to remove <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-needs" target="_self">billions of tons of carbon pollution</a> per year from the atmosphere by midcentury depending on how fast emissions fall in the interim.

Within hours, it had become clear that Stadia’s shutdown, planned for next January, would involve more than just refunding consumer purchases and quietly bowing out.</p><p>Now developers are scrambling to salvage planned projects, migrate players to other platforms, and figure out whether they’re still owed money from Google before the search giant puts Stadia out to pasture for good.</p><hr/><p><strong>Stadia’s shutdown came as a surprise.</strong> Scores of indie game makers, not typically bound by the conservative norms of corporate PR, took to Twitter to explain their frustrations upon learning of the shutdown from news articles and a terse <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five-paragraph blog post</a> from Stadia chief Phil Harrison. </p><ul><li>“Tangle Tower was due to launch on Stadia in 2 days time, and this article was the first I heard about it shutting down,” SFB Games co-founder Tom Vian <a href="https://twitter.com/SFBTom/status/1575558078367690752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Thursday.</li><li>“We have a title coming out November 1st,” Rebecca Heineman, CEO of indie studio Olde Sküül, wrote in response to Vian. “Now we hear about this.” Olde Sküül has since <a href="https://twitter.com/OldeSkuul/status/1575863134857793536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it will release its planned Stadia game, Luxor Evolved, on console and PC in 2023. </li><li>“We have a game coming to Stadia in November.

The consensus: We’re looking into it. </p><ul><li>Ubisoft has been Google’s longest cloud gaming partner, having given the company Assassin’s Creed Origins to test Stadia’s Project Stream predecessor. And with 38 games on the platform, Ubisoft <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> it was “working” to allow Stadia customers to bring those purchases to PC but had nothing more to share. </li><li>“We hear you - we are looking into ways for you to continue your HITMAN experience on other platforms,” <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Hitman developer IO Interactive. </li><li>“All I can say now is that we’re currently looking into the matter, and exploring possible options,” a representative of Cyberpunk 2077 studio CD Projekt Red <a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1576970793006747648" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Verge</a>. </li><li>“We just learned about Stadia shutting down and have begun conversations about next steps for our players,” a Bungie representative <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5Efe3ce7c2836c90e2787ce169a12fbfa6c976cdbd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fdestiny-2-and-hitman-developers-respond-to-google-stadia-shutdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> to the company’s Destiny 2 forums. </li><li>One player of the online component of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 who logged more than 6,000 hours into the game for Twitch and YouTube content has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-onlines-biggest-superfan-may-lose-6000-hours-of-progress-on-stadia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no idea if they can migrate their account</a> off of Stadia. Rockstar has yet to respond to Stadia’s shutdown. </li></ul><p><strong>It’s not clear why Google axed Stadia now,</strong> and why it did so with little to no warning for any of the various parties that invested time, money, and other resources into the platform over the last three years. </p><ul><li>Google is undergoing a serious cost-cutting effort at the moment to contend with the economic downturn. And Stadia was expensive: Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that Stadia spent tens of millions of dollars just to secure rights to a single big-budget release like Red Dead Redemption 2. </li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/google-ceo-says-he-hopes-to-make-company-20percent-more-efficient-hints-at-potential-cuts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last month he wants to make the company “20% more productive,” and hiring slowdowns, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348999/google-pixelbook-canceled-team-shut-down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancellation of a new Pixelbook</a>, and other cost-cutting efforts may have pushed Stadia toward the chopping block.</li><li>Stadia arrived on the gaming scene with big ambitions in 2019 that included developing original exclusives that would make use of the platform’s cloud computing advantages. </li><li>But Google’s internal studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-shuts-down-internal-studios-changing-bus-1846146761" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered</a> less than 18 months after launch, and many of its ambitious cloud features like State Share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-had-big-disruptive-ideas-that-others-should-steal/1100-6507965/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never made it to more than 10% of the platform</a>.</li><li>Ultimately, Stadia chief Harrison said the main culprit was a lack of growth: “While Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected.” </li><li>"The number one problem is the business model. Secondly, you need to deliver something consumers cannot get elsewhere," said Benjy Boxer, the co-founder of game streaming platform Parsec who now oversees the product at Unity. "In my opinion, the only way cloud gaming will ever shift to the mainstream is if we get to a point where we’re not selling the distribution technology and instead selling a unique value proposition." </li><li>Boxer said Stadia had "amazing technology" but failed at selling coherent product and experience. "Stadia never figured out who their customer was," he added.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s perhaps too early to draw broader conclusions about Stadia’s closure,</strong> what it could mean for cloud gaming as a whole, and whether the platform’s demise is the nail in the coffin for Google’s gaming ambitions. But Google’s sloppy handling of the announcement and Stadia’s stunning failure is evidence that even the largest, most experienced companies can find themselves lost in the woods when trying to crack such a notoriously difficult set of problems. </p><p>Cloud gaming is still available on platforms operated by Microsoft, Nvidia, and — for the time being — Amazon, too. But developing games is costly, difficult, and multidisciplinary work that takes years, and streaming those games over the cloud has yet to be accomplished in a sustainable fashion with an attractive business model. Google found this out the hard way, and let’s hope Stadia’s shutdown provides the road map that helps keep its competitors alive.</p><p><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Entertainment newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={This carbon capture startup wants to decarbonize the world’s biggest polluters https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-clean-point-source-capture Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:47:57 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/ceo-and-co-founder-of-carbon-clean-aniruddha-sharma.jpg?id=31859764&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C256%2C0%2C412"/><br/><br/><p>Carbon capture and storage has taken on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-capture-venture-capital-investment" target="_self">increasing importance</a> as companies with stubborn emissions look for new ways to meet their net zero goals. For hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel production, it’s one of the few options that exist to help them get there. </p><p>Yet it’s proven incredibly challenging to scale the technology, which captures carbon pollution at the source. U.K.-based company Carbon Clean is leading the charge to bring down costs. This year, it raised a $150 million series C round, which the startup said is the largest-ever funding round for a point-source carbon capture company. </p><p>Carbon capture and storage is controversial in part due to the industries it serves; while cement and steel makers are among the industries that all but require CCS to lower emissions, oil and gas companies have also shown great interest. Carbon Clean’s latest funding round was led by Chevron, and the technology is seen as a potential lifeline for the fossil fuel industry, despite there being readily available alternatives like renewables and electric vehicles. </p><p>The technology has also been criticized for not delivering the emissions reductions it promises. That includes an infamous case last year involving none other than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/a-shocking-failure-chevron-criticised-for-missing-carbon-capture-target-at-wa-gas-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevron in Western Australia</a>, in which the company missed its targets, and a Shell blue hydrogen project that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shell-ccs-carbon-capture-1848401554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emitted more carbon than it captured</a>. The <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> has also lambasted the Department of Energy for investing $1.1 billion in projects that largely failed to live up to expectations.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop that Carbon Clean is striving to clean up CCS’ image and deliver on its promise. Carbon Clean CEO Aniruddha Sharma told Protocol that fossil fuels are necessary, at least in the near term, to lift the living standards of those who don’t have access to cars and electricity.</p><p>While technologies like CCS hold a lot of promise, helping the world potentially address that issue while still meeting net zero goals, the risks of locking in more fossil fuel use are real, especially if Carbon Clean and other CCS companies can’t scale as promised. CCS also does nothing to help with other forms of local air pollution, which is a major public health concern. </p><p>Sharma, for his part, said he has “done nothing else but carbon capture” his professional life. Along with co-founder and CTO Prateek Bumb, he started working on Carbon Clean’s technology out of university. Bumb had done a five-month internship in Italy studying decarbonization science, and Sharma asked him who was doing that work in India. “No one,” he told him, and thus Carbon Clean was born.</p><p>He spoke to Protocol about what Carbon Clean has learned, the future of point-source CCS, as well as the role of companies like his in battling the climate crisis.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What’s the most challenging part of carbon capture that you’re still working through?</strong></p><p>Scale up is the most challenging part. The technology is working right now. Going from here to the next level of scale up, maybe 10 times bigger, is going to be interesting and challenging, both because you’re trying to increase the equipment size and you’re trying to increase our supply chain. Once you’ve got the materials, then you need a workshop or machining capacity capability that can actually produce the equipment specifically for you. But in the current atmosphere, that’s not something that’s necessarily available. So we’re spending a lot of time on how we scale up both the supply chain and the equipment and the delivery capability.</p><p><strong>You just raised a $150 million series C led by Chevron. A bulk of your investment comes from fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco and Equinor. How do you make sure your work isn’t just a way for them to pay to continue polluting?</strong></p><p>President Biden is asking oil and gas companies to produce more oil, but they’re not necessarily producing that much oil because the market doesn’t necessarily see producing fossil fuels as a good thing to do. So I think people realize that there is a need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and work towards the energy transition. </p><p>From our perspective, whenever you partner with companies like Chevron, we always look for proof in the pudding. Chevron has committed $10 billion to Chevron New Energies, which is solely working on decarbonization. If they have the biggest footprint today, they’re the ones that need the most help decarbonizing. </p><p><strong>How do you make sure the removal project doesn’t negatively impact the local communities adjacent to the carbon capture?</strong></p><p>I think the issue is much deeper: How does the energy transition in general impact the population and the people being affected by it? When these companies start reducing their production, there will be more jobs available and you can reorient a lot of them towards decarbonization. We’re also leading the creation of a new industry that actually didn’t exist. If you think about decarbonization and the level where we need to be — or should be — over the next 10 years, you’re talking about creating five companies the size of Exxon or Chevron in the decarbonization space. These companies will employ tens of thousands of people, so we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of job opportunities to be created for decarbonization. For our company, we ensure that the impact of what we’re trying to do is translated into the local communities.</p><p><strong>How much should your corporate clients be relying on your services when it comes to reaching their net zero or decarbonization goals? In other words, what proportion of their drawdown should come from emissions reductions versus paying for point-source carbon capture?</strong> </p><p>I generally advise our customers to diversify their options. I tell my customers that in 2024, get one unit at your site and spend 10% of your money for decarbonization using one of our carbon capture boxes, spend 10% for another form of decarbonization, and another 10% for electrification, and maybe another 10% for biomass. Try all the options across the board, so that within a year or two, you know which one or two options to scale up. Maybe carbon capture and electrification are the best options for you. If you’re in California, green hydrogen carbon capture is the perfect option for you, so we’re not saying that ours is the only solution. </p><p><strong>But how much of their decarbonization journey should come from any sort of carbon capture versus just not having that pollution be released at all?</strong></p><p>I think that’s where the conundrum is, right? We help decarbonize heavy industries like steel and cement, which are relatively difficult to replace in the medium term. </p><p><strong>But you also work with fossil fuel companies, for which there are renewable alternatives.</strong> </p><p>We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity? We have to keep using heavy industrial products for some time more. And we cannot allow them to just run like that; we have to decarbonize them today. </p><p class="pull-quote">"We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity?"</p><p><strong>So is it your hope that eventually your company won’t have to exist?<br/><br/></strong>I think heavy industry will always exist. So we’ll always be there supporting the decarbonization. If you think about brute numbers, 2 billion people today don’t have access to electricity. <em>[Editor’s note: The International Energy Agency pegs that number at </em><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity" target="_blank"><em>770 million</em></a><em>.] </em>How much of an industrial output needs to be produced to elevate and alleviate poverty for 2 billion people? It’d be immoral to say, “Well, actually, you know what, steel and cement companies, stop tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Bigger picture: How much CCS does the world need? Put a number on what you expect. A gigaton? Less? More?</strong></p><p>Let’s work backwards. Industrial emitters today contribute about 25% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, more or less. That’s about 10 billion tons of emissions. Even if you said that we will be able to electrify some of it or use hydrogen for some part of it, you would still need to decarbonize a significant chunk of that 10 billion tons using point-source carbon capture technologies, and they need to happen between now and 2040. As a company, we are focused on scaling our solution and the availability of that solution to a billion tons per year of carbon dioxide captured. </p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Musk may buy Twitter after all https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:41:39 +0000

While most firms fell into the range of cutting staff two to three months after making funding announcements, a handful of companies waited two weeks or less after going public about funding rounds before making layoffs. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" frameborder="0" height="450" id="datawrapper-chart-gI4RQ" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gI4RQ/5/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Layoffs after announcing new funding"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r</script></div><p><br/></p><p>Are firms blowing through millions in the weeks after the check is deposited in the bank? Experts told Protocol that it's more complicated than that. Startups wait several months to a year after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public with the news, but the delay can result in terrible optics and often a feeling of betrayal among those laid off. </p><h3> Keeping it quiet</h3><p>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” said Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners. A founder may not want their competitors to know about funding, or want to wait until there are other announcements to tack onto a funding round, like a product release or a new executive hire, to do a press push. </p><p>Funding details become more exclusive the bigger an organization gets. At a company with 100 employees, it's easier to keep the news of a major hire or a big VC check from slipping. But at a company with 2,000 people, “announcing it internally is announcing it publicly,” said Alban. “Even if you know everyone is under an NDA, you don't announce something at an all-hands with 2,000 people without expecting that it's going to be leaked.” </p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/business/bolt-layoffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1534872800439279618" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/07/01/homelight-lays-off-a-fifth-of-its-workers-weeks-after-raising-60m/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HomeLight</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/stord-slashes-jobs-after-new-funding-5884514/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stord</a> all drew attention from funding announcements that happened just weeks or days before layoffs.

Plus, big funding announcements don’t always equate to a company’s financial health. Travel startup <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/05/31/pollen-reported-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pollen</a> cut staff after raising funding and collapsed just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/the-next-fyre-fest-startup-pollen-leaves-people-seeking-refunds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three months later</a>. </p><p>Though it’s impossible to know the financial guts of a company from the outside, many will conduct layoffs to extend their runway, Anthony Kline, partner at The GP, told Protocol. Prior to the recent downturn, venture capitalists were “seeing a bit of a gold rush” in tech. But as things have slowed, funding rounds have become harder and harder to come by. “You're able to see the caboose now; you're not gonna see, like, an infinite line of cars.” </p><p>As the economy shifted, so did the role of the founder and CEO, Kline said, changing from “growth product leader to resource allocator.” Jobs that don’t directly align with generating revenue or are duplicate roles are first on the chopping block.</p><p>“If they don't assume that there's some additional round of funding that’s 12 months out, it might be 24 or 36 months out, then they have to be a little bit more creative and a little bit more resourceful,” Kline said. </p><h3>It sucks no matter what</h3><p>It’s difficult to predict if a company will have rocky times ahead, but smart leaders can plan ahead about when to announce funding. If the announcement comes months or a year after closing the round, it gives the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. And, optics aside, layoffs after funding announcements (and in general) are a blow to internal morale. Doing them in a transparent and thoughtful way is crucial. </p><p>Having employees be in the know about company details, financial standing, and what the future of the company looks like might help ease the blow of layoffs. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Kline. </p><p>Being present with your staff amid layoffs, especially in a time of increased remote work, is important to let employees know you’re not disconnected and you’re listening to how layoffs impact them. </p><p>“You see a lot of situations where a founder is so preoccupied with allocating resources, talking to investors, or talking to customers, that they're spending most of their time externally and less so internally,” Kline said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Gary Gensler is keeping up with Kim Kardashian https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/kim-kardashian-emax-crypto-sec Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:23:09 +0000

Kim Kardashian <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax" target="_self">agreed to pay a $1.26 million penalty</a> for failing to report that she got paid to endorse EMAX tokens. It’s a high-profile affirmation of the SEC’s controversial position that most cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities, and just like stock promoters, celebrities better follow the rules if they want to pitch a token to the public.</p><p><strong>Disclosure rules. </strong>“Ms. Kardashian’s case” is a reminder that celebrities must “disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities" like crypto tokens, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183" target="_blank">Gensler said</a>.</p><ul><li>The SEC had actually put out this warning even before Gensler’s time in the wake of the ICO craze a few years ago. In 2017, the regulator cautioned investors <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-potentially-unlawful-promotion-icos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“to be wary of investment opportunities</a> that sound too good to be true” and of “paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons.”</li><li>The following year the SEC announced that boxer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled</a> agreed to pay “disgorgement, penalties and interest” for failing to report that they got paid for touting initial coin offerings. </li></ul><p><strong>The cases underline the perils of celebrity endorsements in the world of investment finance,</strong> where “you can't be paid to promote a stock without disclosing that you're being paid,” Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco regional director, told Protocol. </p><ul><li>Online influencers make a living on hype. But in the world of securities, “overexuberance without proper disclosures and disclaimers is going to be considered misleading and is going to get people in hot water,” Andrew Lom, global head of private wealth at Norton Rose Fulbright, told Protocol. </li><li>Mike Fasanello, chief compliance officer at LVL, said “a seasoned businesswoman like Ms. Kardashian really should have known better considering her career is built largely on advertising and her public image.”</li></ul><p><strong>It’s a significant PR moment for the SEC. </strong>While the regulator has gone after other offending crypto celebrities, the Kardashian case is a “bigger win,” Fagel argued.</p><ul><li>She’s a huge celebrity, after all, whose popularity extends beyond the crypto and finance realms. “There are a lot more people reading about Kim Kardashian” than scouring other cases and news stories involving crypto, he told Protocol. The federal government “has an interest in bringing high-profile cases as a deterrent matter because it gets a lot more attention.”</li><li>In fact, the Kardashian case “may turn into the best public service announcement not to take investment advice from a celebrity,” Bill Callahan, director of government strategic affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. It could also serve as a “warning to others that they must settle their investigations by the SEC” and other law enforcement agencies.</li><li>The fine Kardashian has to pay is “a nominal penalty considering her overall net worth,” Fasanello said. But the SEC action “is meant to educate the masses rather than to penalize the individual.”</li></ul><p>“Simply being a crypto enthusiast publicly isn't going to get anyone in trouble,” even among celebrities, Melody Brue of Moor Insights & Strategy told Protocol. In other words, Matt Damon is probably off the hook for saying that “fortune favors the brave” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crypto.com ad</a>. But trying to make money from touting crypto products is a serious matter, Brue added: “However vague you believe crypto as a security rule to be, it's clear Gensler is going to apply the same regulations, disclosure requirements, and marketing rules that are applied to securities.” </p><p><em>— Benjamin Pimentel (</em><a href="mailto:bpimentel@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="http://twitter.com/benpimentel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM ALIBABA</h3><br/><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="8959dd775f8b0d912fadd71e203ba533" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123996622&iu=/21901267728" id="daa0e" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843641&width=980"/></a><p>Alibaba — a leading global ecommerce company — is a particularly powerful engine in helping American businesses of every size sell goods to more than 1 billion consumers on its digital marketplaces in China.

The outcome could make or break an industry increasingly central to tech companies meeting their net zero goals.</p><p>Globally, Verra — short for the Verified Carbon Standard — issues roughly two-thirds of the carbon credits on the voluntary market, including credits for renewable energy and forestry and land use, among other types. Established in 2007, the registry is the longtime face of the market’s status quo.</p><p>But as demand has surged for carbon credits — particularly as the tech industry looks to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-offsets-shopping-ecommerce" target="_self">meet its net zero targets</a> by offsetting a (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/tech-climate-plan-tips?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">small</a>) portion of its emissions — it has become increasingly clear that scaling the credit market will first require clear standards and transparency. In fact, this is precisely the conclusion that forced a 400-member industry task force on scaling the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/carney-s-bid-to-boost-carbon-market-scaled-back-amid-controversy?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to change tack</a> in 2021. In its wake, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market emerged. It published proposed reforms — including establishing an agreed-upon definition for credit quality and evaluating methodologies accordingly — in July. </p><p>While Verra initially supported the effort, it has since taken issue with the specifics of even these modest potential reforms. Last week, the organization demanded that the council make a “course correction” and took particular issue with the approach that gives credit types that meet the quality definition a thumbs-up in a note to stakeholders.</p><p>“We especially fear that the principles-based review of programs has been supplanted with a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach that seeks to directly set the scope and rules of the market,” Verra wrote in mid-September. Verra also argued for program-by-program evaluation rather than one that evaluates the quality of specific credit types.</p><p>In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/verra-integrity-council" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new analysis</a>, the climate research nonprofit CarbonPlan said Verra’s objection was “melodramatic” and “about control.” </p><p>“The Integrity Council is running a voluntary, opt-in labeling effort — nothing more,” the CarbonPlan team wrote last week. “The Integrity Council isn’t proposing to do anything about credits that fall short of its standards, nor is it clear how they could if they wanted to.”</p><p>Carbon markets are essentially the Wild West. Countless methodologies exist to define what makes for a quality credit, and imposing order on any lawless frontier is proving to be a challenge. But the stakes couldn’t be higher. </p><p>A <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/reform-needed-to-unlock-550-billion-carbon-offsets-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF analysis</a> found that the carbon offset market could be worth as much as $550 billion by 2050, a time period when net zero commitments will come due. However, absent global standard-setting, it is possible that there won’t be enough quality offsets to keep up to the demand. That could mean a lot of money gets wasted on ineffective credits while causing the planet to overheat to dangerous levels. </p><p>The fact that this initial attempt does not have the support of the voluntary market’s biggest player does not bode well. CarbonPlan speculated that at the root of Verra’s objection is a concern that its credits are not “robust enough” to meet the benchmark set out by the council’s proposal, and that new standards “could threaten their dominant position on the supply side of the voluntary market.”</p><p>Verra, for its part, maintains that its concerns are with the process’s efficiency, not with its proposed scrutiny. </p><p>“We don’t wish to see good projects unable to move ahead because the methodology they are using is waiting too long in line for its assessment,” Andrew Howard, Verra’s senior director for climate policy and strategy, told Protocol. “Verra is confident the VCS program will meet the ICVCM’s quality thresholds.”</p><p>Verra proposed several specific “course corrections” for the council, ostensibly with efficiency in mind. First, it argued for evaluating entire programs rather than specific credit types or methodologies. CarbonPlan said that approach “doesn’t pass the laugh test” given that it would force the council to give the whole swath of Verra credits a thumbs-up without acknowledging how much, for instance, a renewable energy credit’s methodology might differ from that of a forestry credit. </p><p>“That is no way to confront the well-documented challenges in the voluntary carbon markets, many of which are present in Verra’s offerings, and it would force the Integrity Council to either bless most of the market uncritically or categorically exclude its largest player,” CarbonPlan said. </p><p>In response, Verra said the council should sample or use spot checks to make sure all of a program’s credit types deserve the council’s approval, but that relying on a methodology-by-methodology evaluation rather than more efficient approaches would leave the council at risk of “seriously bogged down.” </p><p>Verra also took issue with the proposal to step up standards over time and suggested that the council use existing aviation industry offset standards. Taking that approach, though, would ignore the very real need for sharper offset standards and the reality that the aviation industry’s standards are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-un-just-made-it-easier-for-airlines-to-pollute-1844251411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rife with loopholes</a>.</p><p>Regardless of what shape the council’s final reforms take, though, Verra doesn’t have to participate in the council’s proposed benchmarking if it doesn’t want to. If the registry does opt out, it would seriously undermine the scope of any new standards by making two in three carbon credits exempt. </p><p>That puts the council in the midst of a tug-of-war as Verra pulls it to change its plan and CarbonPlan and its other supporters urge it to stay the course. Should the council allow itself to be swayed by Verra’s concerns, CarbonPlan said it could put its very independence at risk.</p><p>“Either [the council members] accede to Verra’s demands and abandon any claim to independence, or they forge ahead and work with only a minority of the current market,” CarbonPlan <a href="https://twitter.com/carbonplanorg/status/1575549005265653760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summarized via Twitter</a>. “We hope they will choose the latter.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={White House AI Bill of Rights lacks specific recommendations for AI rules https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights Tue, 04 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

And, linking to an article about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveillance tech used in China</a> to track and control the Muslim minority Uyghur population there, they alluded to use of AI by autocracies “as a tool of state-sponsored oppression, division, and discrimination.”</p><p class="pull-quote">I categorically reject that kind of framing of it,” Nelson told Protocol. “The document moves as the title says from principles to practice.</p><p>Soon after the announcement, OSTP held several <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public listening sessions</a> in November 2021 on AI-enabled biometric technologies, consumer and “smart city” products, and AI used for employment, education, housing, health care, social welfare, financial services, and in the criminal justice system.</p><p>While some advocacy groups have indicated <a href="https://www.caidp.org/statements/ostp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustration with the slow process</a> for publishing the AI Bill of Rights, Nelson said by one measure — the Biden-Harris administration’s <a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Summit for Democracy</a> held in December 2021 — it is actually early. <br/><br/>“We had committed by December to finish this, and we are completing it with a little bit of time to spare,” Nelson said.</p><p>Scandal has plagued OSTP this year. Former OSTP Director <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/eric-lander-resigns-00006545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lander resigned In February</a> amid accusations he created “an atmosphere of intimidation at OSTP through flagrant verbal abuse.” Later in March, POLITICO revealed that Lander had helped enable an organization led by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to pay the salaries of some OSTP staff.<br/><br/></a>Lawmakers have proposed legislation that would take ethical commitments made by the government out of the realm of theory and into practice. Legislation introduced in February, for example, would <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/revised-algorithmic-accountability-bill-ai" target="_self">require companies to assess the impact of AI</a> and automated systems they use to make decisions affecting people’s employment, finances, and housing and require those companies to submit annual reports about assessments to the FTC.</p><p>Despite a lack of federal AI laws or regulations, the U.S. has agreed to uphold international <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles established in 2019 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> that call on makers and users of AI systems to be held accountable for them, and ensure they respect human rights and democratic values including privacy, non-discrimination, fairness, and labor rights. Those principles also called on AI builders and users to make sure that the systems are transparent, provide understandable and traceable explanations for their decisions, and are safe and secure.</p><p>In conjunction with the publication of the AI Bill of Rights, other federal agencies are expected to signal commitment to take actions reflective of its tenets. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services plans to release recommendations for methods to reduce algorithmic discrimination in health care AI and the Department of Education is planning to release recommendations on the use of AI for teaching and learning by early 2023.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The US is set to expand controls on chip tech for China this week https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/us-china-chips-export-controls Mon, 03 Oct 2022 23:01:22 +0000

Thursday’s announcement is expected to include export controls on chipmaking tools.</p><p>In late August, Nvidia and AMD disclosed they had received notification letters from the Commerce Department ordering them to halt sales of chips designed for artificial intelligence computing.

High-bandwidth memory (which is useful for training large AI models) and flash were among the memory technologies under consideration, the people said. </p><p>Administration officials had been briefed by several memory manufacturers about establishing specific thresholds for flash and high-bandwidth memory, according to another person familiar with the discussions.

The stakes for the legal status quo underpinning the entirety of modern social media are potentially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/texas-elon-musk-free-speech?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">huge</a>, and the outcome is far from certain.</p><p><strong>The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/supreme-court-scrutinize-us-protections-social-media-2022-10-03/" target="_blank">said</a> it will hear <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gonzalez-v-google-llc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a case</a> involving terrorist content on YouTube and whether or not Section 230 immunizes platforms’ algorithms.</strong></p><ul><li>Section 230, of course, says that web platforms, from newspaper comment sections and email providers to Big Tech platforms like Google, can’t be sued over posts that are “provided by another” — a.k.a., by users.</li><li>One of the many, many questions swirling around this law is, when do platforms become so involved with the content that they cease to be separate from users, and can be sued?</li><li>Is it when they were alerted to content by user reports? How about when they promote the content through algorithms? When they add their own warning about it?</li></ul><p><strong>Up until now, federal districts and appeals courts have basically ruled “no” to all of the above,</strong> reasoning that if any were the case, platforms would have to either check almost every single post or ignore all of them.</p><ul><li>Both extremes would be bad for business — a big concern at the dawn of the internet age, in 1996, when the law passed.</li><li>Checking every post (and taking down all the ones that raise any worry of even frivolous litigation) obviously would be bad for free speech.</li><li>But creating a free-for-all would make platforms intensely toxic. The moderation that platforms <em>do</em> do is both arguably both <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/meta-midterms-global-democracy-2023" target="_self">insufficient</a> and also the only thing making some platforms tolerable. </li></ul><p>Under that legal approach, the algorithms that order and recommend content — which, from a technological point of view, are basically the entire point and purpose of social media — <strong>don’t create lawsuit risk for the platforms.</strong></p><ul><li>Nor do fact-checks, labels, failures to act on warnings, and lots of other things.</li><li>It’s not just takedowns and other forms of moderation: Leaving content up and doing nothing with it is also completely fine, under the law.</li></ul><p>Of course, <strong>there’s bipartisan anger that this setup creates huge levels of harm without recourse for those who got hurt, even as some tech companies have gotten very rich.</strong></p><ul><li>Much of that anger focuses on harm that happens at algorithmic scale — whether it’s the spread of child sexual abuse material or mass harassment — because of boosting by Big Tech companies’ very <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/design-wars-ca" target="_self">own</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/california-privacy-transparency?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">designs</a>.</li><li>The case — and an additional case the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/twitter-inc-v-taamneh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will hear</a> involving Twitter — involves terrorist content and attacks, and could offer SCOTUS the ability to narrow court interpretation about just how free social services are to be, well, what they are.</li><li>There may be <a href="https://twitter.com/jkosseff/status/1576934189643239424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real appetite</a> for that kind of narrowing, in fact: The justices appear to have taken up the issue despite the lack of any disagreement in circuit courts, which is more often what <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/section-230-snap" target="_self">prompts</a> them to hear a case.</li></ul><p>By the way, if you thought it was a different issue that touched on Section 230 and seemed <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/hb20-fifth-circuit-stay" target="_self">destined for the Supreme Court</a> — namely,<strong> whether states can require platforms to host conservative content — the justices still could take that up too.</strong></p><p><strong>Both sets of cases create huge uncertainty for tech, though of course a ruling confirming the status quo is possible in both.</strong></p><ul><li>The court may also decide to rule narrowly and only find a small loophole for existing statutes on terrorist content.</li><li>Maybe the justices will follow the framing of the Twitter case and sidestep algorithms altogether, focusing instead on liability in anti-terrorism law.</li><li>But the breadth of potential questions is staggering here, including free speech and design.</li></ul><p>And unlike most of the contentious issues, where the ideological lineup of the court is a good predictor of the outcome, <strong>Section 230 has <a href="https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1576933341894705152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foes</a> and defenders on both sides, and for the most part, we don’t know where the nine justices fall.</strong></p><ul><li>The one exception is arch-conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-section-230" target="_self">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-230-meta" target="_self">called</a> for narrowing when companies get to benefit from the law and for expanding the circumstances where they’re responsible for content.</li></ul><p>I wrote a few weeks ago that the possibility of the Supreme Court taking up the Florida and Texas laws had a real “<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/texas-scotus-issues?rebelltitem=4" target="_self">season finale</a>” vibe — no one knows what’s going to happen and seemingly everything is on the table.

Microsoft Solutions Partners also can earn specializations and expert program status that recognize their expertise and experience in specific technical scenarios under each solution area. </p><p>“What I think is unique about the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is it gives customers total clarity on the partner that has the designations, the specializations that are a great fit for their needs for whatever unique cloud solutions they’re looking for or the transformation that they’re trying to get after,” Dezen said. “It’s like a clear road map, so to speak.”</p><p>A 12-year Microsoft veteran, Dezen most recently served as corporate vice president of device partner sales.

What this means for partners is that they get to differentiate themselves in a very competitive market to customers.</p><p>It’s a really important moment to showcase to partners that we are evolving … as the market is evolving, and we are introducing new capabilities in our programs that let partners focus on their own innovation, leverage our R&D investments, and help customers. The program makes it very easy for partners to understand the things that they need to do to activate all of the resources that we uniquely deliver to partners, whether that’s our R&D investments, our go-to-market scale and capability, or innovation.</p><p>Partners can plug in via skilling, incentives, [or] investments to make sure that they’re getting the best of what I think is Microsoft’s unique differentiation, which is our tech stack plus the combination of the way we go to market, which is the asset of our commercial marketplace combined with our 35,000 [Microsoft field] sellers.</p><p><strong>What’s been the reaction among partners?</strong></p><p>We’ve spent the last six months talking to partners, listening to their feedback, answering their questions. I’m really optimistic that the partners are excited about what we’re doing. They’re excited about the [timing] of this. They see that the portfolio of assets that we’re bringing together with a trusted platform, services, products, and investments for them are so aligned to the way that customers are actually buying products. And it’s aligned to the way that Microsoft sells, so it’s an accelerant for the partners.</p><p><strong>What percentage of partners have decided to join the new program versus renewing their legacy statuses for a year?</strong></p><p>We’re not disclosing specific numbers, but what I will say is partners have the ability to start earning designations immediately. And for partners that aren’t quite ready — first of all, we’re leaning in with resources to help partners make that shift — but they can continue to enjoy their competency benefits uninterrupted through their annual term. They can even renew those benefits after the Silver and Gold badges have retired.</p><p>When Microsoft announced the new program in March, it said partners’ preliminary partner capability scores would be available then, and they had to achieve at least 70 points out of 100 to earn a designation. What percentage of partners needed Microsoft’s help in getting to 70 points?</p><p>Every partner is in a different place on their journey. We have broad-reaching guidance through our partner center that tells partners exactly how they can improve their score in the different categories: performance, skilling, and customer success. Partners can start earning those designations immediately. There are some partners that are well on their way. </p><p>Partners still remain our partners regardless of their designation, and so we’re always going to look for ways to support our partners through any evolutions that are happening with us and in the market. I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are. But I really believe that this program is the thing that’s going to differentiate partners, and so it’s in our interest, in our partners’ interest, and frankly, in the customers’ interests, for partners to lean in and do this work with us.</p><p><strong>The economy has tumbled since Microsoft announced the changes that take effect today. Were any considerations given to partners that might be experiencing economic challenges?</strong></p><p>I actually think the time is better than ever. This is a challenging market, there’s no question about it, but customers need help. They need help to digitally transform, and it’s in their economic interest to do that. We’re giving partners the skills, the resources, the assets, and the partnership to enable them to show customers how they can run their businesses more cost-effectively digitally.</p><p class="pull-quote">I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the changes coming with the industry designations for ISVs?</strong></p><p>There are actually two immediate investments that we’re making around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/program-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ISV Success</a>, which is the pathway for ISVs within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, and then the industry designations. Those are going to be available later this year. They will differentiate solutions based on the demonstrated performance with customers, their technical maturity, and customer success. The first three industries are health care, retail, and financial services. It’s designed with the intent that it will help these ISVs differentiate their solutions by both industry-specific scenarios as well as the broader technology and line-of-business capabilities.</p><p><strong>Can you give a sneak peek of anything else that’s coming after these changes?</strong></p><p>The way to think about it is the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is designed for every partner. We want to invite every partner to participate in it. So the things that you could expect to see in the future are more design capabilities for partners like device partners, mixed-reality partners, learning partners, success partners. We’ll have more specific capabilities roll out as we advance the program.</p><p><strong>What are some common problems or challenges that partners have communicated to you?</strong></p><p>Partners are deciding how quickly they can evolve and modernize their businesses. That’s pretty core to the discussions that we have with partners all the time: How can we help them? How can we help them make more money? How can we help them run thriving, profitable businesses to help their own employees?</p><p>We just published [Microsoft-commissioned research] <a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/microsoft-ecosystem-value-new-data-reveals-partner-paths-to-profitability-and-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from IDC</a>. It’s a great illustration: It talks about how partners that invest with Microsoft see distinct business value and growth. There’s really two things that popped for me. One was that partners that engage deeply with Microsoft see faster growth and higher margins. Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year. The second one is around co-selling and going to market with us. The research showed that the most successful partners we have are engaging across the variety of go-to-market resources with us. These are partners that develop differentiated, value-added approaches to customers that align with Microsoft’s strategy. </p><p class="pull-quote">Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year.</p><p><strong>Are there any emerging technology areas where you’d like to see more partners investing in?</strong></p><p>I’d like to see more partners in all of our solution areas. The party’s open. There are some things that are very timely: certainly security, data, and AI. These are very hot and relevant topics for customers right now, and so that’s pretty core to the conversations that we’re having with our partners.</p><p><strong>Are you going to get involved in trying to bring more female-led partners into the program and promoting greater diversity overall?</strong></p><p>I have a massive responsibility to be a loud voice for diversity and representation in the ecosystem. Any things that we can do to help more diverse partner types participate in our programs, build their own businesses with Microsoft, and then help customers, for me that’s not just a professional win, it’s a personal one.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Tech recruiters' best tips for sourcing talent on LinkedIn https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/best-practices-linkedin-talent-sourcing Mon, 03 Oct 2022 16:54:39 +0000

Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p><hr/><p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul><p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul><p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul><p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul></ul><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Kim Kardashian will pay $1.26 million over crypto post, SEC says https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax Mon, 03 Oct 2022 13:05:05 +0000

Since then the landscape for productivity startups trying to make it on their own has completely changed, especially for those pandemic darlings that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=16f2286b6490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flourished in the all-remote world</a>. </p><p>As recession looms, companies looking to cut costs are less likely to spend money on tools outside of their Microsoft or Google workplace bundles. Enterprise platforms are bulking up and it could spell trouble for the productivity startups trying to unseat them. But Notion COO Akshay Kothari says the company is still aiming to build the next Microsoft, not be the next Microsoft. And in a move signaling a new chapter of maturity, Notion has hired its first chief financial officer: Rama Katkar, Instacart’s former VP of finance.</p><p>Figma, which Kothari called a “sister company” to Notion, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/adobe-to-acquire-figma" target="_self">decided to join Adobe</a> for $20 billion instead of beating them. But Notion is hungry for more. Unlike other startups that have pared down during the downturn, Notion has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-flowdash-acquisition-tender-offer" target="_self">gone on the offensive</a> with acquisitions of calendar app Cron and workflow app Flowdash, as well as launching a global ad campaign. Notion also retained its valuation after <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sequoia-index-purchase-shares-from-notion-employees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees sold shares to investors in a tender offer</a>. Kothari said he doesn’t feel Notion has to “entertain any discussions” about being acquired; there’s more room for Notion to grow, he said, both in the consumer and enterprise spaces. </p><p>“It's almost not worth thinking about the hypotheticals because there's just so much that is left to be done, that we could do ourselves,” Kothari said. </p><h3>IPO or no? </h3><p>Katkar’s hire is a sign Notion may even go public in the near future. The CFO has some experience in this area (Katkar prepped Instacart for its impending, and lately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instacart-plans-to-focus-ipo-on-selling-employee-shares-11663581602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat troubled</a>, IPO.) When Protocol asked about Notion’s IPO plans, she didn’t commit to a “yes” or “no.” Instead, Katkar said Notion is “focused on building” and tackling the international knowledge worker market. </p><p>Whenever a late-stage private company hires a CFO, that means they’re thinking about “the next step,” Wing Venture Capital partner Zach DeWitt said. Going public is typically this next step, and so hiring a CFO with public company or IPO-readiness experience is the way to go. “Usually around $5 million of revenue is when a company starts talking about a VP of finance,” DeWitt said. “By the time the company has $50 million of ARR, they should definitely have a CFO, in the majority of cases.”</p><p>At Instacart and before that at Credit Karma, Katkar developed the financial processes and functions necessary for a maturing company. These IPO-readiness skills apply to private companies too, she noted. </p><p>“That concept of public company readiness is just a framework,” Katkar said. “But in reality, I think even large private companies benefit from operating that way.”</p><p>Katkar was the No. 2 financial officer at both Instacart and Credit Karma, and she feels ready to take on the CFO role. Notion was at the top of her list for its simultaneous consumer and enterprise focus, Katkar said. </p><h3>B to C to B</h3><p>Kothari describes Notion as a “B2C2B” company. Notion doesn’t target CIOs, but rather consumers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-conference-enterprise-productivity-influencer" target="_self">who then work to formalize Notion</a> inside their companies, the so-called <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/cio-shadow-it-saas" target="_self">shadow IT</a> or, in Notion world, “Notion Champions.” Lately, Notion has been working on making its product more translatable for large companies, adding <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-08-29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more admin controls and specific workspaces for teams</a>. But Kothari said he’s not forcing Notion into the enterprise at this point. </p><p>“Eventually, we'll get to a point where we can actually go up to the CIO of a company, who's never heard of Notion, and convince them to roll out Notion company-wide,” Kothari said. “But most of the work right now is happening through the employees, through the community.”</p><p>Notion’s ad campaign, with billboards in London, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco, emphasizes the note-taking tool’s ability to help organize personal life, not just work. Kothari also pointed to the company’s New York City and San Francisco pop-up stands offering bucket hats and coffee as part of the broader brand campaign. This type of branding, as well as the company’s investment in and popularity on TikTok, helps target Gen Z and students who might become Notion worker-champions someday. </p><p>“We can put our energy into making sure our consumers get to use the product for free because we know that downstream, that leads to a B2B business being built in the long run,” Kothari said. </p><p>But Notion’s B2B approach is ultimately not as strong when going up against enterprise software giants with stronger distribution models. DeWitt pointed out that Notion’s valuation is similar to Figma’s at $10 billion, making it a potential candidate for a lucrative acquisition someday. “I’m sure there are some large companies, like Microsoft would be a natural buyer here, maybe even Salesforce, that are thinking about potentially acquiring Notion,” DeWitt said. “It’s a great category, a great team, a great product. It’s got a lot of momentum.”</p><p>Kothari said he feels a close kinship with Figma, as the two companies had similar growth trajectories and similar <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/adobe-figma-dylan-field-user-reactions" target="_self">obsessive, loyal user bases</a>. He’s known CEO Dylan Field for over a decade. The Adobe deal shows “how much existing legacy companies really appreciate the power of these new businesses,” Kothari said. </p><p>Kothari has been through acquisitions twice, with LinkedIn buying his content platform Pulse, and then Microsoft buying LinkedIn. Kothari said it’s not in the cards for Notion, at least not right now. </p><p>“When [Notion CEO] Ivan was recruiting me, he said, do you want to work at Microsoft or do you want to build the next Microsoft?” Kothari said. “I’m personally excited about continuing to build here and seeing if we can continue to remain independent.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Securing the enterprise https://www.protocol.com/manuals/securing-the-enterprise/ Mon, 03 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

Another 23% have too thin a credit file to score or no file at all. That puts them in a credit trap: To build credit, these consumers need someone to give them a line of credit with which they can demonstrate good financial habits. But with scores that low, few lenders are prepared to offer them anything. </p><p>Neobanks say they can solve the problem through a new twist on secured credit cards. But regulators are already scrutinizing their offerings.</p><p>Secured credit cards have been an answer to the thin-credit problem <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/build-credit-with-secured-credit-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for decades</a> because they allow subprime borrowers to open a line of credit when they otherwise can’t by depositing cash upfront. That sum determines the borrower’s credit limit, and gives the banks collateral to hold on to in case of default. However, most require several hundred dollars as a deposit and impose <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp#:~:text=Secured%20credit%20cards%20generally%20come,lower%2Dcost%20forms%20of%20credit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty interest rates and fees</a>, which low-income borrowers struggle to afford.</p><h3>Payback time?</h3><p>Neobanks say they can avoid those problems and still help users build credit through secured credit cards that allow customers to repay their credit balance directly using their deposited cash, rather than keeping that money set aside. The products allow customers to build credit while paying for everyday expenses, neobanks say, without having to save up extra cash first. </p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank describe it as a win-win for consumers and fintechs — consumers can raise their credit scores, and the neobanks earn loyal customers. </p><p>But some in the industry see red flags. “They are, functionally, prepaid credit cards,” fintech analyst Alex Johnson told Protocol. That raises the concern that neobanks may be helping users increase their credit score with a tool that doesn't actually indicate their ability to repay. “If I was a lender, I’d be pissed about having to untangle the trade lines in these consumers’ credit files in order to make sure I wasn’t mistakenly granting credit to high-risk applicants.”</p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards each have similar mechanics: First, a user moves money from a checking account into a separate credit-builder account. The amount of money they move determines their credit limit: If a user moves $200 into the credit-builder account, they can spend up to $200 on a linked secured credit card. Then, at the end of the payment period, users can pay off their credit card balances with the money they’ve deposited — in this example, that same $200. Both Varo and Chime also allow users to sign up for automatic payments. </p><p>Varo and GO2bank told Protocol that it’s that third step — having to pay off the credit card at the end of the payment period — that makes the cards credit cards, not prepaid debit cards. Late payment or failure to repay can damage users’ credit scores. GO2bank additionally charges up to $39 for a late payment. Chime declined to answer any questions for this story. </p><p>With this distinction, neobanks are subject to regulations that govern credit but not debit cards, like the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_truth-in-lending-act.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth in Lending Act</a>. They also, crucially, can market the cards as credit-building tools. The companies make 1% to 2% more in interchange on credit cards than they do on debit cards, <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-marshall-introduce-bipartisan-credit-card-competition-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though pending legislation</a> may curb these fees.</p><p>Visa, on whose network Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards are issued, did not respond to questions about whether the cards resemble prepaid debit cards. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion also did not respond to questions about whether the cards accurately indicate customers’ ability to repay. </p><p>Varo and Go2Bank both say they are not worried about pending legislation changing the amount they can charge on interchange because the credit-building products are not a core source of profit. Rather, representatives of both banks told Protocol the product serves to help them meet customer needs and thus build goodwill with their users. “We’re building deeper connections and deeper engagement,” Raktim Mitra, Varo’s head of credit cards, told Protocol. </p><p>The CFPB acknowledged Varo and Chime’s secured credit-builder products in its <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-credit-card-market-report_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Consumer Credit Card Market Report</a>, without mentioning whether the products might deserve further scrutiny. When Protocol asked the bureau for an update on its views, a spokesperson said that “the CFPB is aware of this market development, and we are monitoring this issue closely.” </p><h3>A spot of ambiguity</h3><p>For consumer advocates, the ambiguity around such programs is a symptom of a larger problem: The CFPB has yet to bring neobanks fully under its regulatory purview. Under the law that created it, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-examinations/institutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bureau can supervise</a> financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets and certain participants in consumer financial markets, like those that work in consumer reporting, debt collection, or the servicing of some loans. </p><p>The bureau invoked a dormant authority to investigate nonbank fintechs in April of this year, though consumer advocates <a href="https://consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFPB-CFA%20Fact-Sheet-CFPB-and-non-banks.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been advocating</a> for more regular and thorough supervision. “There’s no accountability as of right now,” said Rachel Gittleman, head of financial services outreach at the Consumer Federation of America. </p><p>Gittleman’s primary concern with the credit-builders is that consumers may not understand they are using a lending product, despite the terms and conditions laid out in fine print. Though Chime, Varo, and GO2bank each market their products explicitly as secured credit cards, they <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/varo-bank-introduces-varo-believe-a-new-and-better-way-for-millions-of-americans-to-build-credit-301235475.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downplay</a> possible negative impacts on a customer’s credit, and automatic payment options make the products feel more like a regular debit card that doesn’t have default risk.

Today, we’re learning the best ways to source talent on LinkedIn — especially if you’re short on time and resources (read: recruiters). Plus, we’re reading Elon’s text messages from Larry Ellison, Jason Calicanis, and Joe Rogan.</em></p><p class=""><em>— Allison Levitsky, reporter (</em><a href="mailto:alevitsky@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Levitskyyy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>LinkedIn recruiting secrets</h3><br/><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/technology/meta-hiring-freeze.html" target="_blank">Meta</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/27/lyft-freezes-all-us-hiring-amid-stock-slump-economic-downturn/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> have stopped hiring for the year, and that’s music to the ears of other tech companies that are still staffing up. Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p>
<p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><h3>'Haha cool'</h3><br/><p>The world got a glimpse into Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" target="_blank">text inbox</a> this week thanks to his ongoing legal battle with Twitter. Now we know what tech’s power brokers really want: for Twitter to be an “open source protocol” rather than a company (Jack Dorsey), for Musk to move Twitter’s headquarters to Austin and force employees back to the office (Jason Calacanis), and a 24-hour edit button (Gayle King).</p>
<p>Larry Ellison, Reid Hoffman, and Joe Rogan are in there, too. </p>

So what’s next? According to Miller, the next era, including the rivalry between the U.S. and China, is all about computing power.</p><p>That tech rivalry and the story of how the chip industry got from four to 11.8 billion transistors are all part of Miller’s book, “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” which comes out Oct. 4. “Chip War” outlines the nature of the coming battle over semiconductors, showing how the power to produce leading-edge chips fell into the hands of just five companies: three from the U.S., one from Japan, and one from the Netherlands. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Miller touched on the evolving military uses of semiconductors, Russia’s chip procurement problems, and whether onshoring chips won’t necessarily increase the likelihood of a conflict between the U.S. and China. </p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>You write about how the Persian Gulf War became a pivotal moment for understanding the role microchips would play in warfare, especially with guided missiles. Are missiles still the use-case where the military needs the most advanced chips, or has that shifted to other areas like artificial intelligence or cyber attacks?</strong></p><p>I wouldn't necessarily think about individual weapon systems. Chips are important in those weapon systems, but there's also the broader integration of sensors to decision-makers, communication technologies, [and] weapon systems — all of which rely on chips of different sorts. </p><p>So it's the integration that matters as much as the capabilities of any individual system. But as more and more systems start to become more autonomous, the demands for computing power, memory, and communication bandwidth increase on all of these systems. </p><p>So yes, semiconductors are still very important in terms of advances in specific types of munitions, but it's also [about] the ability to integrate them, to transfer information between them, and to have them working together — and all that requires advanced semiconductors at every stage of the process. Militaries are confronting semiconductors everywhere they turn, and their ability to access the right types of semiconductors and more advanced chips is crucial for every aspect of the modern battlefield.</p><p><strong>What’s Russia’s status with the ability to procure semiconductors? There were reports that Russia was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-chips-are-down-russia-hunts-western-parts-to-run-its-war-machines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggling to access</a> chips for the Ukraine conflict. </strong></p><p>Russia does have some domestic chipmaking capacity but it's very, very limited, both in terms of the level of advancement — which is not that advanced — but also in terms of capacity. </p><p>What we've learned from the war — which confirms what we presumed before the war — is that, when you take apart the Russian military system, you'll find lots of foreign-produced chips, and often American-produced chips, inside. Many of these chips are off the shelf — things that you can acquire commercially.</p><p>In some ways, the fact that every military in the world is trying to use commercial chips in their systems has been an equalizing factor. But for Russia, it has presented some challenges too. Russia never really knows whether the chips it's buying have been sabotaged in any way. Every country has that to a certain extent. But the U.S., for example, is relying on chip fabs in the U.S. or in friendly countries — whereas Russia is relying almost exclusively on chips produced in unfriendly countries.</p><p>The systems integration capabilities are also lacking in Russia. They've got some, but there's just a lot more expertise in places like the U.S. or in East Asian countries [for] how you bring different types of chips plus software plus the hardware all together in a coherent system. And I think that's also somewhere we've seen Russia face some difficulties.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo courtesy of Chris Miller</small></p><p><strong>How successful do you think the Chips Plus Act will be? </strong></p><p>There's a question about getting the most bang for our buck out of the Chips Act fund. I think there are ways we can get more or less lucky on that front. But I don't think there's really a serious argument that the Chips Act funding is not going to increase the amount of leading-edge chipmaking capacity in the U.S. We've already seen a number of new facilities being built on the expectations of those funds.</p><p><strong>Does onshoring chip production increase the chances of conflict between the U.S. and China? It seems the U.S. is onshoring production in anticipation of greater conflict, but is it also possible it increases the chances of something happening by reducing the cost of conflict?</strong></p><p>This sort of mutually assured economic destruction thesis — the idea that the U.S. and China or China and Taiwan could never find themselves in a conflict because it would be too costly to do — I think history provides many examples of times in which economically integrated countries ended up in conflict. So that's one reason to be skeptical of it.</p><p>The second reason is that the assumption that was true for most of the period from Deng Xiaoping forward in China — that Chinese leaders were primarily focused on maximizing GDP — that assumption is no longer valid. The last three years of Chinese policy have not been about maximizing GDP but about political goals and zero COVID. It doesn't mean that they're not going to care at all about economic issues. But we shouldn't assume that either China or the U.S. or Taiwan is approaching these issues solely from the perspective of making sure trading continues unharmed.</p><p>The lesson of 2022 is not that economically integrated powers can't quickly decouple, because we've seen that in a shocking way between Russia and Europe. So I don't think we should take much comfort in the fact that there's a lot of economic integration between China, Taiwan, the U.S., and other countries in the sense that is going to guarantee a peaceful outcome. I don't think history suggests that's true.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Big Tech’s facade is crumbling https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/hiring-freeze-downturn-big-tech Sun, 02 Oct 2022 10:00:00 +0000

As part of this, we occasionally reprioritize the roles we need to fill and offer similar roles to candidates with pending offers,” the company told Protocol in an emailed statement. </li><li>Privately, sources say the environment has changed noticeably across the company, with a clear focus on cost-cutting. </li><li>And Amazon isn’t alone.

Yes, there were respectable amenities, like big cafeterias and workout centers. But employees weren’t getting massages, napping in pods, or swilling Kombucha on tap. </li><li>Then Silicon Valley came along and changed the paradigm. The can-do, entrepreneurial vibe was matched with enviable perks that helped make a job in tech the decade’s hottest LinkedIn accessory. </li></ul><p><strong>Now, industry leaders are left to grapple with the beast they created. </strong>And it’s somehow a surprise to them that after decades of insane perks, employees are <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/anti-perks-benefits-corporate-culture" target="_self">pushing back</a> on efforts to curtail those benefits. </p><ul><li>“‘We shouldn’t always equate fun with money,” Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-infamously told employees</a>.

It’s officially spooky season.</em></p><p><em>This week in the startup world: VCs rethink the office, inside the Twitter deal-making, and Cloudflare tries to woo startups.</em></p><h3>VCs rethink where — and what — their office spaces are </h3><br/><p>In the pre-pandemic times, Contrary’s network of venture scouts, founders, and top technologists reflected the magnetic pull Silicon Valley had on the tech industry. About 80% were based in the Bay Area, with a smattering living elsewhere. Today, when Contrary asked where people in its network were living, the split had changed with 40% in the Bay Area and another 40% living in or planning to move to New York.</p><p>It’s totally bifurcated now, said Contrary’s founder Eric Tarczynski. “That was a big wake-up call for us. Before the pandemic, New York wasn’t even really on the road map,” Tarczynski said. “A huge cross-section of engineers are now in New York.”</p><p><strong>Sand Hill Road is losing its shine as more VCs rethink where they’re located. </strong>That’s not to say the Bay Area is over (I’d argue far from it). But cities like New York are still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/09/every-firm-is-talking-about-it-venture-capital-is-having-its-new-york-moment/?sh=5f6b0e487fa3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“having their moment”</a> and continue to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2022-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grow in share of venture deals</a> over the Bay Area. </p><ul><li>In the last year, venture firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed have added offices in New York City. </li><li>Check-writing partners for Greylock and Threshold VC moved to NYC, while other firms have stealthily set up shop with small teams working out of WeWorks. Even the reporters covering Silicon Valley <a href="https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1574490494918443042" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are moving to NYC</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>There’s another strategy change afoot. </strong>More venture firms are experimenting with building community spaces instead of more offices for their partners to work out of. </p><ul><li>In New York, Tarczynski’s venture firm built Contrary NYC, a space that’s meant to be like <a href="https://www.protocol.com/contrary-nyc-founder-space" target="_self">a Soho House for techies</a> (minus the pool, restaurants, and hotel rooms). It’s supposed to evoke the feel of a club where engineers and entrepreneurs can hang out together, have a space to work, and host events for people in tech. In the last few weeks, there have been female founder dinners, comedy shows, and an appearance by Serena Williams at a launch party for startup Parfait held at Contrary NYC. </li><li>In Los Angeles, Brianne Kimmel’s Worklife fund opened up its new <a href="https://www.worklife.vc/studios/silverlake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worklife Studios</a> space in the Silver Lake neighborhood. She advertises the space as a location where “Discords and DAOs can host events, remote workers can meet new people, and anyone can enjoy our eclectic schedule of gatherings — from dinner parties with the neighborhood to album listening parties with artists.” This past weekend, a thousand people <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1573382493616877569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were waiting in line</a> to get into its space: The band Wallows was doing a pop-up merch store.</li></ul><strong>Part of it is finding a tribe outside of Silicon Valley. </strong>In SF, it can be frustratingly homogenous with many people working in and around the tech industry. In NY and LA, there’s more diversity and with that more opportunity for VCs to step in and be that beacon for the tech communities in a way that’s not as needed in a market like the Bay Area. “For the past 20 or 30 years, SF was the only game in town,” Tarczynski said. “Having a little bit more distribution and even talent flow is frankly pretty good for the venture community.”<h3>Overheard</h3><br/><p><strong>“This makes it seem like I’m desperate. Please stop,” </strong>Elon Musk texted angel investor Jason Calacanis over his promotion of an SPV to buy Twitter shares. Court filings filled with Elon Musk’s texts this week showed the fascinating network of relationships and power brokers that surround Musk in this deal — and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players" style="" target="_self">the things that they’re angling for</a>. Steve Jurvetson suggested Emil Michael for the job of CEO, but Musk shot it down in favor of someone with actual software experience. Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman both signed off to invest billions via text. Calacanis had the most interesting relationship with Musk, sending off ideas about charging people, forcing employees back to the office, and even throwing his name in the ring for CEO. Musk asked if he wanted to be an adviser, and Calacanis replied “Board member, advisor, whatever.” “[Y]ou have my sword.” That tone changed later on when Musk appeared miffed at Calacanis after Morgan Stanley and Musk employee Jared Birchall were “very upset” with the way Calacanis was running the deal and that he was taking advantage of his friendship with Musk. “Only ever want to support you,” Calacanis replied <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">in the texts</a>. </p><p><strong></strong><strong>“Some of the business practices don’t rise to the level of ethics that we’re all used to in private equity with your investors and your customers and your community, and that has been a bit disappointing,”</strong> said Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo in a rebuke of the crypto industry. After buying shares in FTX and a handful of other crypto companies, the private equity billionaire <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c5dd6c35-d3e2-4602-a8e4-54266990cfd3?tpcc=nltermsheet" target="_blank">told the FT</a> that he’s backing off investing in the crypto market for now despite remaining long-term bullish on the sector.</p><strong>“When my friend asks if I want to invest, of course I’m going to kick in $10,000 — it’s a way to stay connected, an excuse to get updates,” </strong>an anonymous startup founder <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/silicon-valley-turns-angel-investing-into-a-social-currency" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a>.

Gavin Newsom signed into law a <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20212022/SB1008/" target="_blank">bill</a> that makes phone calls from California’s prisons free of charge. The new law places the cost of calls not on incarcerated people — or the people receiving calls from them — but on the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p><p>California is the second state after Connecticut and the biggest state by far to institute such a law, which is a direct shot at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-cost-prison-communications-driving-debt-racial-wealth-gap-2021-6" target="_blank">$1.4 billion prison telecom industry</a>. For years prison telecom companies have maintained rates that “can be unjustly and unreasonably high, thereby impeding the ability of inmates and their loved ones to maintain vital connections,” the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-takes-next-big-steps-reducing-inmate-calling-rates" target="_blank">said</a> in 2020. </p><p>Prison reform advocates argue the new California law will have a hugely positive impact on the families of incarcerated people in California — and potentially other states that follow California's lead.  <span></span></p><hr/><p>"From a public policy perspective,  we should be wanting people to stay connected to their social networks, to their families, to be able to start looking for employment if they are close to getting out," said state Sen. Josh Becker, who sponsored the bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1008" target="_blank">SB 1008</a>. "But we have a very perverse system, which inhibits that and actually throws many families into debt."</p><p>For years, the high cost of prison phone calls has sapped money from low-income families with incarcerated loved ones. According to <a href="https://ellabakercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-Pays-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 report</a> by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, 34% of families go into debt in their attempt to maintain contact with loved ones inside through phone calls and visitations. The impact is disproportionately felt by women of color, because of the corresponding disproportionate number of men of color in America’s prisons.</p><p>Now, with the governor's blessing, "the simple cost of a call is never going to impair their ability to tell their children they love them or help their partner problem-solve a parenting situation,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a prison reform organization, which was a key player in advocating for the bill.</p><p>The new law covers the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2022/09/Tpop1d220928.pdf" target="_blank">93,000 incarcerated people</a> in the state's prison system, and Becker hopes future legislation will extend free calls into California's city and county jails, as well.</p><p>In addition to making calls free to users, the law prohibits local agencies from “receiving revenue for the provision of communication services to persons in its custody." The law also charges the state’s utility commission with ensuring service does not fall below standard, now that calls are free. Proponents of the law say the policy change will cost California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-23/prison-jail-communication-california-senate-bill-1008" target="_blank">about $12 million annually</a>, but that is a small fraction of the <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4517" target="_blank">$14.2 billion budget for the state’s corrections department</a>.</p><p>In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has tried to clamp down on the astronomical costs charged by prison telecom providers including slashing fees and capping rates at 21 cents per minute for interstate calls in 2013. More recently, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-improved-communications-access-incarcerated-people" target="_blank">adopted</a> a rule to prevent prison phone companies from seizing pre-paid funds from users, after one prison telecom giant, GTL, was found to have <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/fcc-gtl" target="_blank">seized</a> $121 million in customer funds. Other local governments have notched their own victories in the fight against sky-high prison call rates. In 2019, New York became the first major city jail system to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/connecticut-free-prison-phone-calls-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">make calls free</a>. In 2020, San Francisco also made phone calls from its jails free and <a href="https://sfgov.org/financialjustice/newsletters/san-francisco-announces-all-phone-calls-county-jails-are-now-free" target="_blank">announced a policy change</a> that would "permanently stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families through phone calls."</p><p>But advocates are hopeful that California's law will set an example for other state governments, because of the sheer size of its prison population. “California has a much bigger system,  and what it does matters to the rest of the corrections community,” Tylek said. “It will be a huge trendsetter for everyone else.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Great products come from strong patents https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/great-products-are-built-on-strong-patents Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000

</p><p>In today’s knowledge-based economy, IP rights play a foundational role. “Core R&D is the first step in getting good products into people’s hands,” said John Smee, senior VP of engineering and global head of wireless research at Qualcomm.<em> “</em>Everything from smartphones to the Internet of Things, automotive and industrial innovation begins as a breakthrough within our research labs.” At Qualcomm, Smee said, strong IP laws help the company confidently conduct cutting-edge 5G and 6G wireless research that will make its way into products ranging from everyday consumer goods to the factory floor. </p><p>Semiconductor companies, in particular, are fiercely protective of their IP because it’s their primary competitive advantage. Chip companies go to extraordinary lengths to protect their IP by maintaining black boxes only accessible to one person per fab, choosing highly secure operating locations, and keeping R&D teams separate from fab operations teams.</p><p>On the legal side, America’s Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 bestows legal protection of chip topography and design layout IP while the EU’s Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products of 1986 protects IC design. These regulations “have encouraged firms to continue to innovate,” according to the findings of Qualcomm’s and Accenture’s report, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6108671984&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harnessing the power of the semiconductor value chain</a>.Having a high-quality patent portfolio also helps companies build out their ecosystem, should they choose to license, through advising, training, support for launches, assistance in expanding to new markets, and much more.</p><p>Licensing democratizes innovation and invention— it makes the cutting-edge IP developed by one firm accessible to a broad range of others. As such, it allows other companies to skip the R&D step and jump right into building on the innovator’s foundation. This lowers the barrier to entry for upstart companies while providing a steady return on investments for the companies who have the resources to dedicate to heavy R&D.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><strong>An outsize economic impact</strong></p><p>IP protection also has an outsized impact on the US economy and helps create good higher-paying jobs. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105345571&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A report from The United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) found that in 2019 industries that intensively use IP protection account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (or about $7.8 trillion) and employ one-third of the total workforce — that’s 47.2 million jobs. In 2019, the average weekly earnings of $1,517 for workers across all IP-intensive industries was 60% higher than weekly earnings for workers in other industries.</p><p>Workers in IP-intensive industries were more likely to earn higher wages as well as participate in employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement plans, the USPTO report found.</p><p> But patent laws are often subject to much debate — one person’s idea of protection is another’s view of monopoly. That’s where organizations like <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105346519&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeadershIP</a> come into play. The group brings together experts on IP and innovation to debate issues at the intersection of research, policy, and industry.</p><p>In addition, several efforts are underway to help inventors get their ideas into the marketplace. The Inventors Patent Academy (TIPA), for instance, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent. TIPA has designed its program to make patenting more accessible and understandable for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQIA, lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Closing these gaps would promote U.S. job creation, entrepreneurial activity, economic growth, and global leadership in innovation. Estimates suggest that increasing participation by underrepresented groups in invention and patenting would quadruple the number of American inventors and increase the annual U.S. gross domestic product <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6106154609&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">by nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>If we want our nation’s rich history of innovation to continue, experts say, we must create an IP protection ecosystem that helps ensure that tech innovation will thrive.</p><p>“With the protection of patents,” Smee said, “there is no limit to where our creativity can take us.”</p>

<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/titus-welliver-as-harry-bosch-in-freevee-s-bosch-legacy-holding-a-flashlight.jpg?id=31860744&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C36%2C0%2C371"/><br/><br/><p>Amazon’s streaming efforts have long been all about Prime Video. So the company caught pundits by surprise when, in early 2019, it launched a stand-alone ad-supported streaming service called IMDb Freedive, with Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/amazons-imdb-launches-a-free-streaming-service-freedive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the move</a> “a bit odd.”</p><p>Nearly four years and two rebrandings later, Amazon’s ad-supported video efforts appear to be flourishing. Viewership of the service <a href="https://videoweek.com/2021/09/23/imdb-tv-is-quietly-becoming-an-avod-juggernaut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew by 138%</a> from 2020 to 2021, according to Amazon. The company declined to share any updated performance data on the service, which is now called Freevee, but a spokesperson told Protocol the performance of originals in particular “exceeded expectations,” leading Amazon to increase investments into original content by 70% year-over-year.</p><p>Key to Freevee’s success has been its deep integration with Prime Video and Fire TV, where it lives alongside ad-free subscription fare, pay-as-you-go rentals, and third-party subscription channels. Now Amazon is looking to broaden its international reach.</p><p>“I'm very excited about the possibility of an ad-supported service in front of the paywall in many countries,” said Ryan Pirozzi, who has been working on Amazon’s video strategy for over a decade and became head of Freevee in August.</p><h3>IMDb TV was not standing out</h3><p>When Amazon first launched its free video service, it was looking to capitalize on the IMDb brand it has owned since 1998. “Our early thinking was, people recognize that brand,” said Pirozzi. However, the branding didn’t exactly catch on with consumers, in part because IMDb was best known as a database for industry professionals. </p><p>Changing the service’s name to IMDb TV did little to solve those issues, which is why the company ultimately switched to the Freevee brand in April of this year. “IMDb TV wasn’t standing out as much as Freevee is,” Pirozzi said. “Personally, I’m very happy we rebranded.”</p><p>Third-party data suggests the rebrand is working: The service’s mobile apps generated about as many downloads since the rebrand as it did during the years preceding it, according to estimates by app intelligence company Sensor Tower. For the five months following the rebrand, downloads were up 113% compared to the preceding five months.</p><p>The total number of installs of the Freevee mobile app is still fairly small, with Sensor Tower estimating the app  has been downloaded 3.3 million times from Google Play and the App Store, while Google’s own data puts the number of downloads from Google Play between 5 and 10 million.</p><p>The service is closely integrated with Prime Video, where its movies and shows are being presented as “free with ads.” Mixing subscription-exclusive content with free, ad-supported videos <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/smart-tvs-content-first" target="_self">can be confusing to consumers</a>, but Pirozzi argued that it was a trade-off for being able to offer more choices, which also includes access to pay-as-you-go movie rentals. </p><p>“We have to work on eliminating any confusion,” he said, adding that Freevee was growing both as a stand-alone service and within Prime Video. “I think people are getting it. Our best SVOD customers are our best TVOD customers [and are also] our most engaged AVOD customers.”<br/></p><h3>Uncertain times for streaming</h3><p>The ascent of Freevee happens as the entire streaming industry is rediscovering free, ad-supported video. Fox has plans to turn its free Tubi streaming service into a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/tubi-will-become-a-billion-dollar-business-foxs-lachlan-murdoch-says" target="_blank">billion-dollar business</a>; Viacom’s Pluto TV reached that same milestone <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>. Even Netflix, which long resisted advertising, is <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-microsoft-ads-partners" target="_self">getting ready to launch an ad-supported tier</a>. </p><p>At the same time, there are some signs that parts of the industry are slowing their investments into originals in light of a more challenging economic climate. Warner Bros. Discovery, for instance, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-strategy?rebelltitem=1" target="_self">canceled several projects for HBO Max recently</a>. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9">

</p><p>“I guess I must have missed the memo,” Pirozzi retorted, pointing to the fact that Freevee’s investments into originals have increased by 70%. Some of the originals running in the service include “Bosch: Legacy,” a spin-off of the police procedural “Bosch” that ran on Prime Video for seven seasons; “Judy Justice,” a remake of “Judge Judy”; and ex-con comedy “Sprung.”</p><p>These shows may not pay for themselves, but they do work to attract new audiences. “Originals and pay-window movies are a customer acquisition driver,” Pirozzi said. “Then we drive depth of engagement with licensed content, deeper catalog, and linear channels. That model has been working for us, and we see big uplifts in our business when we launch something like a ‘Bosch: Legacy.’”</p><p>Many of these originals are also being repurposed for linear free ad-supported streaming channels, also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/plex-live-tv-linear-streaming" target="_self">known as FAST channels among industry insiders</a>. “This rise of FAST linear channels is so fascinating,” Pirozzi said. “To some people, it’s sort of retro. It’s in a linear format without pause or fast forward. But that’s really growing and working for us.”</p><p>Freevee’s more than 100 free linear channels are closely integrated with Amazon’s Fire TV platform, where they are presented as part of the live TV tab. The linear format also allows Amazon to carry some content that it would otherwise not have the rights to, Pirozzi explained. “‘Kim’s Convenience,’ one of my favorite shows on Netflix, is not available to license on demand,” he said. However, Amazon was able to license the show as a linear channel, which it now streams to Freevee viewers.<br/>Freevee debuted in Germany in August after expanding to the U.K. last year. Now, the service is looking to jump into new territories.</p><p>“We have greater international expansion plans,” Pirozzi said. He declined to share Amazon’s exact road map, but suggested that there may be opportunities in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Asia, among others.<br/></p><p>“There are so many places where the value proposition of an ad-supported video product will be very popular with customers,” he said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Biden’s AI Bill of Rights shoots for the stars.

Today we look at the AI Bill of Rights from the White House and how it fits into the existing privacy push by Congress. As you have likely already heard, the Twitter deal is back on. Also, Micron plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in a New York state chip factory thanks to the Chips-Plus package.</em></p><h3>Pie in the sk(AI)</h3><br/><p>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday unveiled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. The document is lofty and well intended, but not particularly practical in the near term — nor to the liking of some AI watchdogs, as Protocol’s Kate Kaye <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights" target="_self">pointed out</a>.</p><ul><li>The white paper sketches out five standards that will help ensure automated systems don’t infringe on our rights: protection from unsafe systems, equitable/nondiscriminatory algorithms, agency over our data, transparency over automated systems, and access to opt-outs and remedies. </li><li>(Sorry, if you were expecting a <a href="https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1577367260510924802?s=20&t=QfFlXeQ5cbsQuosM0y4wog" target="_blank">manifesto on the rights of sentient robots</a>, look elsewhere.) </li></ul><p><strong>The OSTP is careful to emphasize that it’s only intended to support the development of official policies.</strong> In other words, the AI Bill of Rights has as much legal authority as this newsletter. Still, it’s useful in that it represents a sort of regulatory wish list for the Biden administration. </p><ul><li>To be fair, the OSTP includes a lot of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-enterprise/white-house-ai-samsung-chips?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">precise, prescriptive guidance</a> for corporations. The infeasibility doesn’t come from the lack of specific guidance, then, but from the fact that corporations are unlikely to respond unless compelled by the government. </li><li>Some of the guidance is also so disruptive to the status quo that it would remake entire industries. For example, the AI Bill of Rights advises that “you should be able to opt out from automated systems in favor of a human alternative.” But there simply <em>aren’t</em> human alternatives at scale for much of what we do on the internet.</li></ul><p><strong>Sometimes the OSTP doesn’t even seem sure of its own recommendations.</strong> For example, the bill of rights calls for unchecked surveillance to be avoided unless “strictly necessary” but then goes on to say national security agencies should only abide by these guidelines “where feasible.” So, you know … restaurants should never charge extra for guac, but Chipotle can do so “when convenient.” </p><p><strong>These feasibility challenges persist in the prescriptions for the private sector.</strong> </p><ul><li>The OSTP calls for the timely removal of user data from machine learning systems trained with that data. But as I’ve <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/pipelines-data-privacy-design" target="_self">noted before</a>, companies often have no idea where user data flows within their own data pipelines. This complexity likely makes it impossible to comply with existing privacy laws, including the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a>. </li><li>The OSTP also tells companies they should be doing “proactive equity assessments” while also not tracking or using proxies for demographic features. How do you verify lack of bias against a demographic while also ensuring you can’t track it? </li></ul><p><strong>The bill of rights goes above and beyond the primary federal bill under consideration — and that may be its greatest strength. </strong>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text#H88DA5D95E892448B9DDA6F37E0106E77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a> is a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/privacy-draft-2022" target="_self">big deal</a>, even if it suffers from a significant <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/privacy-preemption-adppa?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">preemption problem</a>. But next to the AI Bill of Rights, it looks somewhat unambitious: </p><ul><li>There’s overlap in the sense that both the ADPPA and the AI Bill of Rights say Americans should be able to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/federal-privacy-law-introduced?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">request</a> their information, request that it be deleted, and tell companies to change personal information when it’s not accurate.</li><li>But the bill of rights <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/#privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes</a> many more ambitious privacy goals, including more rigorous consent standards for obtaining user data and better data protections in sensitive user domains such as health care and education. </li><li>The ambiguity and idealism in the AI Bill of Rights can be criticized as its greatest weakness, but in some sense they are its greatest strength: The document shows the federal government is at least thinking of privacy in a much more ambitious way than the bills in Congress would let on. </li></ul><p>The OSTP shot for the stars. Congress is still on the ground building a privacy foundation. That combination in itself can be a great thing. But if ADPPA ends up not passing, what use do we have for a starry-eyed bill of rights? </p><em>— Hirsh Chitkara (</em><a href="mailto:hchitkara@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/hirshchitkara" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em><h3>In Washington</h3><br/><p><strong>The Twitter <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">deal</a></strong><strong> is back on … probably.</strong> Elon Musk on Tuesday sent a letter to Twitter saying he’d buy the company at his original offered price of $54.20 per share.

One area that’s being built out is crypto trading as a service, with APIs and other products that developers and companies can use to set up crypto trading for their clients. </p><p>The latest sign of this maturation is EDX Markets, a new exchange for digital assets that’s being developed by Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab, as well as venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm.</p><p>The digital exchange, headed by former Citadel Securities executive Jamil Nazarali, is roughly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-and-others-start-crypto-exchange-edx-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeled</a> on and built on the trading technology of Members Exchange, or MEMX, another exchange that’s being developed by similar companies as an alternative to large stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq.</p><p>EDXM’s custody and wallet technology is being provided by crypto custody and infrastructure company Paxos, the companies announced Wednesday</p><p>Paxos, which is a custodian regulated by New York state, holds customer accounts in fully segregated accounts and has signed up large consumer-facing clients to enable crypto trading. Its customers include PayPal, broker dealers such as Interactive Brokers, and others such as Nubank and Mastercard. Paxos has a conditional bank trust charter from the <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCC</a> and says it expects its chartered entity, Paxos National Trust, to open later this quarter.</p><p>Up until now big banks haven’t moved heavily into crypto because of accounting, risk, security, and regulatory concerns, as well as requirements by the Federal Reserve and a desire for more mature technology, said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “We still haven't seen any of the big bank holding companies in the U.S. bring one of these offerings to market,” he added.</p><p>EDXM, with its leadership and backing from Wall Street firms, could attract large banks into digital assets, he said. EDXM is “bringing traditional market structure and also traditional market participants to this liquidity offering through the exchange that is going to be really built to support and attract these types of bank holding companies and brokerages,” Hessert said. For example, EDXM plans to offer delivery settlement versus payment <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/172104/edx-markets-ceo-vows-to-learn-from-travails-at-rival-institutional-crypto-exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settlement</a>, a settlement method that’s used in traditional securities trading. </p><p>EDXM is also different from some other crypto providers that are the market maker, exchange, and custodian all in one, which can be a conflict of interest and is typically not done in traditional markets, Hessert said.</p><p>More large liquidity pools such as EDXM will also increase transparency for the crypto market, Hessert said. Presently, crypto markets can be opaque, with large spreads and high volatility.</p><p>The competition to provide crypto trading, custody, security, and related technology for large institutions is intense. The resulting consolidation wave isn’t without some hiccups: Wyre canceled its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/bolt-axes-15b-deal-to-buy-crypto-infrastructure-provider-wyre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal</a> to be acquired by Bolt for $1.5 billion last month. But more deals could soon come in this sector, since numerous providers offer overlapping services, analysts say. </p><p>Coinbase provides crypto trading APIs, custody, payments API, and related services, seeking to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/coinbase-cloud-node" target="_self">lure big and small</a> customers alike. Coinbase has three related APIs — a general-purpose one for trading, deposits, withdrawals, and tax reporting; another for streaming market data; and a specialized FIX API for sophisticated traders. Coinbase, which recently announced a deal with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/blackrock-to-offer-crypto-for-institutional-investors-through-coinbase-prime/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, has an advantage in routing orders to its own exchange or, for large customers using its Prime API, to other liquidity providers. </p><p>A number of other API providers like Prime Trust, MoonPay, Wyre, and Transak have emerged to offer quick and easy connections to crypto trading and other services, particularly for fintech and crypto developers building apps. Custody providers such as Anchorage and Fireblocks also offer crypto trading.

Too bad. https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/apple-app-store-price-hike Wed, 05 Oct 2022 11:15:09 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/apple-s-planned-price-hike-is-going-into-effect.png?id=31864079&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><strong>Good morning! </strong>Apple hiked App Store prices by around 20% in some markets outside the U.S. without any explanation and with barely any notice. Critics are unsurprisingly upset, but what choice do they have?</p><h3>It’s Apple’s party, and it’ll charge if it wants to</h3><br/><p>The App Store just became a little pricier for many non-U.S. customers. Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e1b1hcmv&1663640181" target="_blank">planned price hike</a> went into effect today for any market that uses the euro, in addition to Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In most markets, the price increase equates to about 20% higher costs for apps (though it’s even more in some countries, like Japan and South Korea). So a mobile app that was previously 0.99 euros now costs 1.19 euros, while the same is true for an in-app purchase like mobile game currency. Curiously, Apple isn’t saying why exactly, leaving developers to guess whether it’s due to currency fluctuations, the related global economic crisis, or perhaps rising energy costs related to operating the App Store overseas. </p>
<p><strong>The price hike is arriving at a sensitive time. </strong>The combination of record inflation and a looming global recession has started to take a serious toll on foreign markets as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/16/business/strong-dollar.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strength of the U.S. dollar continues to grow</a> relative to weakening foreign currencies like the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. </p><ul><li>While Apple has yet to raise prices in the U.S., it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/apple-raises-iphone-14-price-in-uk-japan-australia-overseas-markets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiked the price</a> of the new iPhone 14 lineup in Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K., in some cases by the equivalent of nearly $150. </li><li>A number of other consumer electronics companies, including PlayStation maker Sony, have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enacted similar hardware price hikes</a> in the EU and other markets in recent months. </li><li>Apple can certainly afford to weather any economic storms better than most, if not all, of its competitors. In its last earnings announcement from July, Apple said it had a record Q3 with $19.6 billion in services revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. </li><li>The company remains the most valuable in the world with a market cap of more than $2.3 trillion. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple critics are not pleased. </strong>Naturally, a price hike with little explanation and on such short notice is going to rankle Apple's usual detractors in the developer community, including Fortnite maker Epic Games. But the criticisms have grown especially pointed given the current economic climate. </p><ul><li>“These increases were made without the input or consent of app developers, which highlights the extent of Apple’s market power. In no other industry can a business single-handedly increase the prices of another business’s products,” <a href="https://appfairness.org/coalition-for-app-fairness-blog-on-apple-price-increases/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Rick VanMeter, the executive director for the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness, of which Epic, Match Group, and Spotify are members. </li><li>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had harsh words, too. “Imagine if a landlord told their small business tenant they had to increase their prices without any say in the matter or anywhere else to go,” he said in a statement yesterday. “That is what Apple is doing to developers for no other reason than to pad Apple’s bottom line.”</li><li>“Developers don't want to raise their app prices in the EU and UK. Consumers don't want app price increases in the EU and UK. Central banks fighting inflation don't want app price inflation,” Sweeney wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1577032444955746304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">follow-up tweet yesterday</a>. “But Apple is raising developers' prices against developers' wishes.” </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple is no stranger to sudden price increases. </strong>For decades, the iPhone maker has exercised near-total control of its software ecosystems, including the digital storefronts it has operated since the days of iTunes. </p>
<ul><li>You might remember when Apple infamously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/apple-begins-variable-pricing-on-itunes-store-some-songs-now-129-each/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the price</a> of newer, more popular MP3s on the iTunes Store from 99 cents to $1.29. The move, a concession to the music industry, helped <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/09/itunes_price_increases_mean_slower_sales_for_music_labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labels sell more albums</a> after years of complaints that the era of iTunes pushed consumers toward buying singles over albums. There was plenty of hand-wringing at the time, but nothing really changed. That is, until music streaming took off and individual song sales began to decline. </li></ul>
<p>But there is no comparable distribution change for mobile apps or the App Store on the horizon. Apple sets the rules for commerce on iOS, and everyone must follow — so long as they want to reach iPhone customers.<br/><br/><em>— Nick Statt</em><br/></p><h3>The Twitter drama has only just begun</h3><br><p>Elon Musk decided, seemingly out of nowhere, that he actually <em>will</em> buy Twitter. But before you assume the roller coaster ride is over, think again.</p>
<p><strong>Musk <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">sent a letter</a> to Twitter </strong>proposing to buy the company at the original, agreed-upon price of $54.20 a share provided the company agrees to forget the whole court battle. Twitter shares jumped on the news before exchanges halted trading.</p>
<ul><li>The news coincidentally broke at the same time Twitter employees were entering a long meeting about its 2023 strategy. Very funny, we know.</li><li>Twitter said it received Musk’s letter and intends to close the deal at the original price. It hasn’t addressed Musk’s proposal to end its lawsuit.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk and Twitter could be entering even muddier waters, </strong>where the company will transition to a whole new owner who has expressed rather controversial ideas about the service. What happens next could go like this, as described by Protocol Policy editor Kate Cox:</p><ul><li>Step one: Musk buys Twitter!</li><li>Step two: ???</li><li>Step three: Twitter reaches profitability under Musk.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk loves to prove the skeptics wrong, </strong>and turning Twitter around could be another way to do it. But those question marks are there for a reason: the details of how he would do it are beyond murky. </p><ul><li>How will Twitter employees — the ones who haven’t fled the company in droves as the acquisition moil unfolded, that is — react? </li><li>How will he handle the spam problem he cited as an excuse to walk away from the deal?</li><li>Musk offered one cryptic hint about his plans in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>: “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-elon-musk-buys-his-old-x-com-domain-from-paypal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reclaimed</a> the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, and has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1557199404301307904" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teased</a> the idea of building a Twitter competitor on it.</li></ul>There are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/twitter-lbo-revives-12-5-billion-headache-for-wall-street-banks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questions about the debt financing</a> needed to close the deal, and Musk and Twitter will have to thrash out what to do about the pending lawsuit. But if they can overcome those obstacles, Twitter will get a new owner and a different future. The one true thing we can say about both: They are completely unpredictable.<br/><br/><p><em>— Sarah Roach</em></p><h3>​The calm before the storm</h3><br><p>Hundreds of companies that cut staff in recent months announced major funding rounds just a few months before. But startups aren’t blowing through their funding weeks after the check is deposited; it’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/layoffs-funding-data" target="_self">more complicated than that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Startups often wait several months to a year </strong>after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public about it.</p><ul><li>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners, told Nat. </li><li>This is because founders often want to announce funding with other big news, like a product release or an executive hire. </li></ul>
<p><strong>The bigger an organization gets, </strong>the more secretive it becomes about funding updates. News of a big check is easier to keep from leaking publicly at a company of 100 compared to a company of 2,000, Alban said. </p><ul><li>Companies like Bolt, Getir, and Trade Republic caught flack for this very reason. Many employees said they felt betrayed, as funding announcements gave the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. </li><li>“Bolt employees were blind sided because the CEO was saying just weeks ago how everything is fine,” <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Bolt-just-layed-off-people-in-the-worst-way-possible-yL7QauTE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an anonymous user wrote on the message board Blind</a>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>To help ease the blow of layoffs, </strong>being transparent can go a long way. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Anthony Kline, a partner at VC firm The GP.<br/><br/><em>— Nat Rubio-Licht</em><br/></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM CAPITAL ONE SOFTWARE</h3><br><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="0b87547b908f01341fe8a968efb24080" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123932305&iu=/21901267728" id="b689f" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843120&width=980"/></a>Many business leaders aren’t sure where to begin when it comes to migrating to the cloud.

The legislation allowed some families to <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/taxact/file-for-less-and-get-more/understanding-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly double</a> their tax benefits per child, which was especially critical for low-income families, who disproportionately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/04/20/covid-19-pandemic-pinches-finances-of-americas-lower-and-middle-income-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bore the financial brunt</a> of the pandemic. </p><p>For Amanda Renteria, the <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/safety-net-innovation-lab-audacious-ted-talk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEO of Code for America</a>, the new legislation meant the work had only just begun. Renteria understood that making tax credits available is one thing, but helping families navigate bureaucracy to get them is another. Renteria also knew that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a nonprofit that helps the government use technology to better serve communities, could play a critical role in addressing that access problem. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Renteria explained how she made the decision to develop a proof of concept for an app that would help people claim the Child Tax Credit. Code for America developed this mock-up despite limited resources and no guarantee that it would be selected by the government as its technology partner. The leap of faith ended up paying off, and Code for America reported in May that it <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/code-for-america-getctc-portal-returns-for-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped</a> 115,000 families successfully claim the tax benefit throughout the 2021 tax filing season. </p><p><em>Renteria’s story, as told to Protocol, has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What we knew about the IRS, having worked with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program [last year], is just how hard it is for people to get through [the system to get benefits].</strong> With VITA, we helped create an online, mobile-friendly, simplified application that actually walks you through [the process] in both English and Spanish. </p><p><strong>When Child Tax Credit came up, we knew that this policy — though it passed and everyone was excited about it — would actually hit a wall. </strong>We had seen the barriers over time on much easier processes, like food assistance in some states. </p><p><strong>We knew filling out forms is extremely difficult.</strong> So there wasn't even a question of whether or not we could make this process better. Again, [this was] largely because we had been doing it for a while. We helped VITA sites go online the year before, and we could actually see how you improve throughput if you have a simplified process.</p><p><strong>The big question for us was whether we wanted to build it, knowing we weren't sure whether it would land. </strong>A lot of the question was how we bring the White House, the Treasury, and the IRS up to speed with our lessons learned. We are a small nonprofit. There were no guarantees that anyone would believe us — trust not only our data, but our ability to do it. </p><p><strong>We felt our need to jump in because we didn’t see it happening anywhere else. </strong>During that period of time, we were still in transition to a new administration, so we knew that the federal government was still building up its digital talent. The private sector was also focused on higher-end clients and how they were going to live in a new online world. Everything was changing during a pandemic, and the only way we were going to reach [families] was through their phones, and trying to be as simplified and trustworthy as possible.</p><p><strong>So in very short order, our engineering team put together a mock-up of what it would look like.</strong> [It showed] what the experience would be, how we would triage, how we would ensure that clients are being taken care of through chat. We were able to turn this around in a couple of weeks, but it was based on 10 years of research. We were really confident in our ability to create a front door that spoke to the clients we were trying to serve. We were less confident in whether or not it would be enough to show [the White House] what's possible.</p><p><strong>In a meeting with the White House and Treasury, we walked through the actual process someone would go through.</strong> Within that, not only did we build trust in terms of the relationship we already had, but the tangibility of seeing the vision of what was possible was a key difference for them. But that took some risk on our part — we had to build it before we knew whether it would actually be a relationship that could lead to the scale we have now proved to have.</p><p><div id="series-box"></div>

With the change, Parikh is now the sole chief executive of the privately held company, a prominent up-and-coming player in cloud security that last year achieved a valuation of $8.3 billion.</p><p>Lacework planned to inform employees of the change on Tuesday. Hatfield, who previously served as president at Pure Storage, leaves Lacework's executive leadership a few months shy of his second year with the company. </p><p>As part of the co-CEO model, Hatfield, who goes by the nickname "Hat," focused on business operations and expansion at Lacework, which has raised $1.85 billion in funding. Hatfield joined Lacework as CEO and chairman in early 2021. He could not immediately be reached Tuesday.</p><p>Parikh joined as co-CEO in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-lacework-jay-parikh" target="_blank">mid-2021</a>, and has focused on product and engineering for the company. The two have known each other for two decades, having previously worked at the same time at Akamai Technologies.</p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Parikh characterized the move as planned and amicable, prompted by conversations between "Hat, myself, and the board" that led to the conclusion that the co-CEO model was no longer the best fit for the company. Lacework's executive leadership and board have been "looking at where the business is and what it needs to get to the next level," and have determined that "unifying the company" under a single CEO made the most sense right now, Parikh said.</p><p>When it comes to Lacework's product and sales strategy and its relationships with customers, partners, and the big public cloud platforms, the move should help with "making sure that's all unified [around] one set of priorities with one focus," he said.</p><p>Parikh said he doesn't believe Hatfield has "any immediate plan to go jump into anything full-time anytime soon." Hatfield is "still going to be spending a good amount of time" on Lacework, Parikh told Protocol.<br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-right" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: right;">

</p><p>Founded in 2014, Lacework offers a "data-driven" service that aims to stand out in the fast-growing cloud security market by collecting and analyzing data from across a customer's cloud environments. The goal is to to provide customers with crucial security insights, such as which threats to prioritize for action, the company has said.</p><p>The company raised a $525 million funding round in January 2021, followed by an additional $1.3 billion in funding in November 2021 that brought with it the $8.3 billion valuation. Lacework touted that round as "the largest funding round in security industry history," and the company ranks at No. 3 in terms of the biggest valuations for privately held security companies, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank">CB Insights</a>.</p><p>Lacework is also notable for having been just the third company to be incubated out of Sutter Hill Ventures, following a model that was used to launch Pure Storage and Snowflake. The Lacework platform supports AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as Kubernetes environments. </p><p>In May, Lacework disclosed that it had laid off <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/lacework-layoffs-cloud-security-startup" target="_blank">20% of its staff</a>, in response to what the co-CEOs <a href="https://www.lacework.com/blog/lacework-update/" target="_blank">then described</a> as a "seismic shift" in "both the public and private markets." The company had previously <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/cybersecurity-has-53-unicorns-here-are-10-to-watch/" target="_blank">reported</a> having more than 1,000 employees as of March, and did not immediately have a figure available for its current employee count on Tuesday.</p><p>Prior to Lacework, Hatfield had previously spent nearly seven years as president at Pure Storage followed by 16 months as its vice chair, according to his LinkedIn. He joined the company as president in 2013, a few years into its founding, and stayed on through its initial public offering and its first several years as a public company.</p><p>While there are no plans to directly replace Hatfield at Lacework, given the unification of the CEO duties under Parikh's leadership, the company does plan to hire a chief revenue officer in the near future, Parikh said.</p><p>Ultimately, Lacework's leadership is focusing on making moves that will set it up "to be successful over 10, 20 years — we're not building this to be a transaction," Parikh said. <br/></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The future of pay transparency in tech https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/pay-transparency-in-tech-sb1162 Tue, 04 Oct 2022 22:07:11 +0000

We spoke with Susan Alban, operating partner and chief people officer at Renegade Partners, and compensation consultant Ashish Raina to learn how.</p><hr/><p><strong>Startups will adopt pay bands earlier.</strong> Five or 10 years ago, it wasn’t unusual for 50-person companies to be operating without a “career ladder” or “career architecture” with compensation bands for different job functions and levels, Alban said.</p><ul><li>Today’s tighter labor market — and demands from candidates — mean that companies structure their compensation bands sooner.</li><li>Because the new law applies to companies with just 15 employees, even tiny startups will be required to define their pay bands in a more structured way, Alban said.</li><li>“Which is a little funky when you have, like, eight people, to have a band for every single job, because sometimes you just have one person in a job,” she said. “It just nudges companies to be a little bit more thoughtful in defining what is the job, what is the relative seniority, and what would we reasonably pay relative to market-based pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>Companies may find other ways to differentiate pay in order to compete for the best talent. </strong>The law only requires companies to disclose base pay, not stock, bonuses, or benefits. </p><ul><li>This means bonuses and equity could become more important forms of compensation, which may shift the issue of unequal pay to other areas.</li><li>Bonuses “can be very arbitrary,” especially in early-stage companies where goals change all the time, Alban said.</li><li>They may prove to be even more important levers for attracting and retaining great employees, however. “Fair pay is not equal pay,” Raina said. “If someone is more proficient or more highly performing in a role, there should be a differentiation in pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>The law might provide a little more incentive for companies to hire outside of California, </strong>but not much. The law on its own is unlikely to have a major effect on where companies hire, but it adds more administrative headache to California employers.</p><ul><li>“I don’t hear employers talking about not wanting to hire in the state of Colorado because of these laws,” Alban said.</li><li>Some companies may choose to advertise jobs with a national labor rate that would overpay candidates in low-cost states like Mississippi but underpay Californians, Raina said.</li></ul><p><strong>Big companies are likely to comply more readily than startups.</strong> An online job search shows companies like Google, Salesforce, and Twitter listing pay ranges in ads. Some listings cite the Colorado law explicitly.</p><ul><li>“I think the general consensus among progressive technology employers is that this is the way the world is going,” Alban said. “Rather than fret about it and deviate from hiring in particular regions to avoid compliance, better to just comply anyway.”</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li>Some startups likely won’t comply with the law, Raina said. “They’re trying to survive,” he said. “Yes, this law exists, and yes, there’s going to be some risk if they don’t comply, but that isn’t necessarily people’s forefront of an issue.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The EU ushers in the USB-C era https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-apple-iphone-ewaste Tue, 04 Oct 2022 19:32:24 +0000

The mandate will extend to laptops in 2026. </p><p>The rule — which was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-charging-ewaste" target="_blank">introduced in June</a> — passed 602-13, while eight members abstaining from voting. That reflects an overwhelming desire to make the average person's life easier (goodbye, cluttered junk drawer) as well as cut down on pernicious e-waste. While the decision means that ports such as micro-USB will fall by the wayside, Apple's Lightning port is also slated to go the way of the dinosaur. </p><p>The company's iPad and various MacBooks rely on USB-C charging. But Apple has held steadfastly to the technology for the iPhone, rolling out its most recent iteration of the phone with a Lightning rather than a USB-C port. The iPhone was the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/31/european-smartphone-market-2021/" target="_blank">bestselling phone</a> in the EU last year, with Apple capturing 34% of the smartphone market.</p><p>The European Council needs to sign off on the legislation before it officially goes into law. But that prospect looks likely. After that, the clock to USB-C hegemony begins counting down. The timing could work out well for Apple at least; the company releases a new iPhone every year in September. With the mandate likely to take effect in fall 2024, it means next year's iPhone could well be the last one to feature a Lightning port — unless Apple decides to just get the switch over with, something the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066661/apple-iphone-15-drop-lightning-port-usb-c-2023-prediction-rumor" target="_blank">company is reportedly considering</a>. </p><p>The company could also make a USB-C version of the iPhone for the EU and a Lightning version for everyone else, of course, but that seems unlikely given the logistical hurdles. The iPhone could also go totally portless for charging, though that would be a much more radical leap. <br/></p><p>As written, the rule would allow electronics without a USB-C port to continue being sold as long as they are "placed on the market before the date of application," according to a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the vote. Regardless, if you're a Lightning stan, uh, you should consider snapping up an iPhone 14 sooner than later.</p><p>Cutting down on e-waste is a sneaky climate policy. The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Pages/Spotlight/Global-Ewaste-Monitor-2020.aspx" target="_blank">Global E-Waste Monitor</a> put out by the United Nations showed that nearly 54 million tons of e-waste piled up in 2020, a number that could rise to almost 75 million tons by the end of this decade. That's a local environmental concern given the toxic chemicals and components. But it's also a huge waste of emissions. More than two-thirds of the carbon pollution tied to electronics is emitted in the manufacturing process. </p><p>Cutting down on the number of charging cables produced (and trashed) is a relatively modest way to cut down on e-waste. Stronger policies that favor right-to-repair as well as companies working harder to stave off forced obsolescence could also offer a pathway to reduce the amount of electronic churn. Improving e-waste recycling is yet another avenue to cut down on trash; the Global E-Waste Monitor found only 17.4% of electronic trash is currently recycled. Apple and other tech companies have touted moving toward a circular economy as central to their sustainability goals. While the EU's USB-C mandate alone won't make that transition magically happen, it could spur further innovation and serve as a reminder of all the work that remains to be done.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Why $100 per ton is the carbon removal industry's holy grail https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-removal-cost-per-ton Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:03:51 +0000

It’s one of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/frontier-cdr-purchases-stripe-alphabet" target="_self">Frontier’s</a> stated criteria that the fund uses to evaluate its advance purchases. In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of the long-duration carbon removal community, CarbonPlan found that stakeholders are focused on the $100 benchmark. The Department of Energy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/climate/glasgow-carbon-removal-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even announced</a> that it would be investing in carbon removal research to bring the cost of the technology down to $100 per ton.</p><hr/><p><strong>Where did that number come from? </strong>In short, it’s the cost per ton of removal services that it would take for the CDR industry to reach commercial viability. It’s based on a handful of factors. </p><ul><li>It’s the point at which carbon removal becomes affordable at the scale needed to make it a meaningful tool to reach net zero (and, eventually, negative emissions), Shuchi Talati, a senior visiting scholar at Carbon180, told Protocol. </li><li>It evolved from modeling and policy conversations, and is aligned with other existing costs, like the European Union’s carbon price (which will likely reach that number in a decade). </li><li>It’s also tied to the social cost of carbon, a metric that measures the economic damage a ton of carbon emitted causes. Estimates of the social cost of carbon keep increasing as climate damages become clearer.</li><li>Another reason could be much simpler. The climate community could just be taking its cue from the DOE, anchoring its own targets to the agency’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Carbon Negative Shot target</a>, which was set for $100 per ton, CarbonPlan’s Danny Cullenward wrote in an email to Protocol.</li></ul><p><strong>So far, no one has come anywhere close to reaching that target. </strong>Currently, most carbon removal services cost well above $100 per ton, although the Inflation Reduction Act’s updated 45Q tax credit of up to $180 per ton for direct air capture could help some startups get closer to achieving that target. </p><p>“$100 per ton is an extremely ambitious 10-year target, likely probably more of a 15- to 20-year target,” Talati said. But she thinks it’s “important to be ambitious,” and “there’s a lot of momentum around CDR and getting these technologies to scale.”</p><p>The world could have to remove <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-needs" target="_self">billions of tons of carbon pollution</a> per year from the atmosphere by midcentury depending on how fast emissions fall in the interim.

Within hours, it had become clear that Stadia’s shutdown, planned for next January, would involve more than just refunding consumer purchases and quietly bowing out.</p><p>Now developers are scrambling to salvage planned projects, migrate players to other platforms, and figure out whether they’re still owed money from Google before the search giant puts Stadia out to pasture for good.</p><hr/><p><strong>Stadia’s shutdown came as a surprise.</strong> Scores of indie game makers, not typically bound by the conservative norms of corporate PR, took to Twitter to explain their frustrations upon learning of the shutdown from news articles and a terse <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five-paragraph blog post</a> from Stadia chief Phil Harrison. </p><ul><li>“Tangle Tower was due to launch on Stadia in 2 days time, and this article was the first I heard about it shutting down,” SFB Games co-founder Tom Vian <a href="https://twitter.com/SFBTom/status/1575558078367690752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Thursday.</li><li>“We have a title coming out November 1st,” Rebecca Heineman, CEO of indie studio Olde Sküül, wrote in response to Vian. “Now we hear about this.” Olde Sküül has since <a href="https://twitter.com/OldeSkuul/status/1575863134857793536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it will release its planned Stadia game, Luxor Evolved, on console and PC in 2023. </li><li>“We have a game coming to Stadia in November.

The consensus: We’re looking into it. </p><ul><li>Ubisoft has been Google’s longest cloud gaming partner, having given the company Assassin’s Creed Origins to test Stadia’s Project Stream predecessor. And with 38 games on the platform, Ubisoft <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> it was “working” to allow Stadia customers to bring those purchases to PC but had nothing more to share. </li><li>“We hear you - we are looking into ways for you to continue your HITMAN experience on other platforms,” <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Hitman developer IO Interactive. </li><li>“All I can say now is that we’re currently looking into the matter, and exploring possible options,” a representative of Cyberpunk 2077 studio CD Projekt Red <a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1576970793006747648" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Verge</a>. </li><li>“We just learned about Stadia shutting down and have begun conversations about next steps for our players,” a Bungie representative <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5Efe3ce7c2836c90e2787ce169a12fbfa6c976cdbd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fdestiny-2-and-hitman-developers-respond-to-google-stadia-shutdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> to the company’s Destiny 2 forums. </li><li>One player of the online component of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 who logged more than 6,000 hours into the game for Twitch and YouTube content has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-onlines-biggest-superfan-may-lose-6000-hours-of-progress-on-stadia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no idea if they can migrate their account</a> off of Stadia. Rockstar has yet to respond to Stadia’s shutdown. </li></ul><p><strong>It’s not clear why Google axed Stadia now,</strong> and why it did so with little to no warning for any of the various parties that invested time, money, and other resources into the platform over the last three years. </p><ul><li>Google is undergoing a serious cost-cutting effort at the moment to contend with the economic downturn. And Stadia was expensive: Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that Stadia spent tens of millions of dollars just to secure rights to a single big-budget release like Red Dead Redemption 2. </li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/google-ceo-says-he-hopes-to-make-company-20percent-more-efficient-hints-at-potential-cuts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last month he wants to make the company “20% more productive,” and hiring slowdowns, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348999/google-pixelbook-canceled-team-shut-down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancellation of a new Pixelbook</a>, and other cost-cutting efforts may have pushed Stadia toward the chopping block.</li><li>Stadia arrived on the gaming scene with big ambitions in 2019 that included developing original exclusives that would make use of the platform’s cloud computing advantages. </li><li>But Google’s internal studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-shuts-down-internal-studios-changing-bus-1846146761" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered</a> less than 18 months after launch, and many of its ambitious cloud features like State Share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-had-big-disruptive-ideas-that-others-should-steal/1100-6507965/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never made it to more than 10% of the platform</a>.</li><li>Ultimately, Stadia chief Harrison said the main culprit was a lack of growth: “While Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected.” </li><li>"The number one problem is the business model. Secondly, you need to deliver something consumers cannot get elsewhere," said Benjy Boxer, the co-founder of game streaming platform Parsec who now oversees the product at Unity. "In my opinion, the only way cloud gaming will ever shift to the mainstream is if we get to a point where we’re not selling the distribution technology and instead selling a unique value proposition." </li><li>Boxer said Stadia had "amazing technology" but failed at selling coherent product and experience. "Stadia never figured out who their customer was," he added.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s perhaps too early to draw broader conclusions about Stadia’s closure,</strong> what it could mean for cloud gaming as a whole, and whether the platform’s demise is the nail in the coffin for Google’s gaming ambitions. But Google’s sloppy handling of the announcement and Stadia’s stunning failure is evidence that even the largest, most experienced companies can find themselves lost in the woods when trying to crack such a notoriously difficult set of problems. </p><p>Cloud gaming is still available on platforms operated by Microsoft, Nvidia, and — for the time being — Amazon, too. But developing games is costly, difficult, and multidisciplinary work that takes years, and streaming those games over the cloud has yet to be accomplished in a sustainable fashion with an attractive business model. Google found this out the hard way, and let’s hope Stadia’s shutdown provides the road map that helps keep its competitors alive.</p><p><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Entertainment newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={This carbon capture startup wants to decarbonize the world’s biggest polluters https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-clean-point-source-capture Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:47:57 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/ceo-and-co-founder-of-carbon-clean-aniruddha-sharma.jpg?id=31859764&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C256%2C0%2C412"/><br/><br/><p>Carbon capture and storage has taken on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-capture-venture-capital-investment" target="_self">increasing importance</a> as companies with stubborn emissions look for new ways to meet their net zero goals. For hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel production, it’s one of the few options that exist to help them get there. </p><p>Yet it’s proven incredibly challenging to scale the technology, which captures carbon pollution at the source. U.K.-based company Carbon Clean is leading the charge to bring down costs. This year, it raised a $150 million series C round, which the startup said is the largest-ever funding round for a point-source carbon capture company. </p><p>Carbon capture and storage is controversial in part due to the industries it serves; while cement and steel makers are among the industries that all but require CCS to lower emissions, oil and gas companies have also shown great interest. Carbon Clean’s latest funding round was led by Chevron, and the technology is seen as a potential lifeline for the fossil fuel industry, despite there being readily available alternatives like renewables and electric vehicles. </p><p>The technology has also been criticized for not delivering the emissions reductions it promises. That includes an infamous case last year involving none other than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/a-shocking-failure-chevron-criticised-for-missing-carbon-capture-target-at-wa-gas-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevron in Western Australia</a>, in which the company missed its targets, and a Shell blue hydrogen project that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shell-ccs-carbon-capture-1848401554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emitted more carbon than it captured</a>. The <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> has also lambasted the Department of Energy for investing $1.1 billion in projects that largely failed to live up to expectations.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop that Carbon Clean is striving to clean up CCS’ image and deliver on its promise. Carbon Clean CEO Aniruddha Sharma told Protocol that fossil fuels are necessary, at least in the near term, to lift the living standards of those who don’t have access to cars and electricity.</p><p>While technologies like CCS hold a lot of promise, helping the world potentially address that issue while still meeting net zero goals, the risks of locking in more fossil fuel use are real, especially if Carbon Clean and other CCS companies can’t scale as promised. CCS also does nothing to help with other forms of local air pollution, which is a major public health concern. </p><p>Sharma, for his part, said he has “done nothing else but carbon capture” his professional life. Along with co-founder and CTO Prateek Bumb, he started working on Carbon Clean’s technology out of university. Bumb had done a five-month internship in Italy studying decarbonization science, and Sharma asked him who was doing that work in India. “No one,” he told him, and thus Carbon Clean was born.</p><p>He spoke to Protocol about what Carbon Clean has learned, the future of point-source CCS, as well as the role of companies like his in battling the climate crisis.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What’s the most challenging part of carbon capture that you’re still working through?</strong></p><p>Scale up is the most challenging part. The technology is working right now. Going from here to the next level of scale up, maybe 10 times bigger, is going to be interesting and challenging, both because you’re trying to increase the equipment size and you’re trying to increase our supply chain. Once you’ve got the materials, then you need a workshop or machining capacity capability that can actually produce the equipment specifically for you. But in the current atmosphere, that’s not something that’s necessarily available. So we’re spending a lot of time on how we scale up both the supply chain and the equipment and the delivery capability.</p><p><strong>You just raised a $150 million series C led by Chevron. A bulk of your investment comes from fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco and Equinor. How do you make sure your work isn’t just a way for them to pay to continue polluting?</strong></p><p>President Biden is asking oil and gas companies to produce more oil, but they’re not necessarily producing that much oil because the market doesn’t necessarily see producing fossil fuels as a good thing to do. So I think people realize that there is a need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and work towards the energy transition. </p><p>From our perspective, whenever you partner with companies like Chevron, we always look for proof in the pudding. Chevron has committed $10 billion to Chevron New Energies, which is solely working on decarbonization. If they have the biggest footprint today, they’re the ones that need the most help decarbonizing. </p><p><strong>How do you make sure the removal project doesn’t negatively impact the local communities adjacent to the carbon capture?</strong></p><p>I think the issue is much deeper: How does the energy transition in general impact the population and the people being affected by it? When these companies start reducing their production, there will be more jobs available and you can reorient a lot of them towards decarbonization. We’re also leading the creation of a new industry that actually didn’t exist. If you think about decarbonization and the level where we need to be — or should be — over the next 10 years, you’re talking about creating five companies the size of Exxon or Chevron in the decarbonization space. These companies will employ tens of thousands of people, so we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of job opportunities to be created for decarbonization. For our company, we ensure that the impact of what we’re trying to do is translated into the local communities.</p><p><strong>How much should your corporate clients be relying on your services when it comes to reaching their net zero or decarbonization goals? In other words, what proportion of their drawdown should come from emissions reductions versus paying for point-source carbon capture?</strong> </p><p>I generally advise our customers to diversify their options. I tell my customers that in 2024, get one unit at your site and spend 10% of your money for decarbonization using one of our carbon capture boxes, spend 10% for another form of decarbonization, and another 10% for electrification, and maybe another 10% for biomass. Try all the options across the board, so that within a year or two, you know which one or two options to scale up. Maybe carbon capture and electrification are the best options for you. If you’re in California, green hydrogen carbon capture is the perfect option for you, so we’re not saying that ours is the only solution. </p><p><strong>But how much of their decarbonization journey should come from any sort of carbon capture versus just not having that pollution be released at all?</strong></p><p>I think that’s where the conundrum is, right? We help decarbonize heavy industries like steel and cement, which are relatively difficult to replace in the medium term. </p><p><strong>But you also work with fossil fuel companies, for which there are renewable alternatives.</strong> </p><p>We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity? We have to keep using heavy industrial products for some time more. And we cannot allow them to just run like that; we have to decarbonize them today. </p><p class="pull-quote">"We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity?"</p><p><strong>So is it your hope that eventually your company won’t have to exist?<br/><br/></strong>I think heavy industry will always exist. So we’ll always be there supporting the decarbonization. If you think about brute numbers, 2 billion people today don’t have access to electricity. <em>[Editor’s note: The International Energy Agency pegs that number at </em><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity" target="_blank"><em>770 million</em></a><em>.] </em>How much of an industrial output needs to be produced to elevate and alleviate poverty for 2 billion people? It’d be immoral to say, “Well, actually, you know what, steel and cement companies, stop tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Bigger picture: How much CCS does the world need? Put a number on what you expect. A gigaton? Less? More?</strong></p><p>Let’s work backwards. Industrial emitters today contribute about 25% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, more or less. That’s about 10 billion tons of emissions. Even if you said that we will be able to electrify some of it or use hydrogen for some part of it, you would still need to decarbonize a significant chunk of that 10 billion tons using point-source carbon capture technologies, and they need to happen between now and 2040. As a company, we are focused on scaling our solution and the availability of that solution to a billion tons per year of carbon dioxide captured. </p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Musk may buy Twitter after all https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:41:39 +0000

While most firms fell into the range of cutting staff two to three months after making funding announcements, a handful of companies waited two weeks or less after going public about funding rounds before making layoffs. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" frameborder="0" height="450" id="datawrapper-chart-gI4RQ" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gI4RQ/5/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Layoffs after announcing new funding"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r</script></div><p><br/></p><p>Are firms blowing through millions in the weeks after the check is deposited in the bank? Experts told Protocol that it's more complicated than that. Startups wait several months to a year after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public with the news, but the delay can result in terrible optics and often a feeling of betrayal among those laid off. </p><h3> Keeping it quiet</h3><p>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” said Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners. A founder may not want their competitors to know about funding, or want to wait until there are other announcements to tack onto a funding round, like a product release or a new executive hire, to do a press push. </p><p>Funding details become more exclusive the bigger an organization gets. At a company with 100 employees, it's easier to keep the news of a major hire or a big VC check from slipping. But at a company with 2,000 people, “announcing it internally is announcing it publicly,” said Alban. “Even if you know everyone is under an NDA, you don't announce something at an all-hands with 2,000 people without expecting that it's going to be leaked.” </p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/business/bolt-layoffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1534872800439279618" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/07/01/homelight-lays-off-a-fifth-of-its-workers-weeks-after-raising-60m/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HomeLight</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/stord-slashes-jobs-after-new-funding-5884514/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stord</a> all drew attention from funding announcements that happened just weeks or days before layoffs.

Plus, big funding announcements don’t always equate to a company’s financial health. Travel startup <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/05/31/pollen-reported-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pollen</a> cut staff after raising funding and collapsed just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/the-next-fyre-fest-startup-pollen-leaves-people-seeking-refunds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three months later</a>. </p><p>Though it’s impossible to know the financial guts of a company from the outside, many will conduct layoffs to extend their runway, Anthony Kline, partner at The GP, told Protocol. Prior to the recent downturn, venture capitalists were “seeing a bit of a gold rush” in tech. But as things have slowed, funding rounds have become harder and harder to come by. “You're able to see the caboose now; you're not gonna see, like, an infinite line of cars.” </p><p>As the economy shifted, so did the role of the founder and CEO, Kline said, changing from “growth product leader to resource allocator.” Jobs that don’t directly align with generating revenue or are duplicate roles are first on the chopping block.</p><p>“If they don't assume that there's some additional round of funding that’s 12 months out, it might be 24 or 36 months out, then they have to be a little bit more creative and a little bit more resourceful,” Kline said. </p><h3>It sucks no matter what</h3><p>It’s difficult to predict if a company will have rocky times ahead, but smart leaders can plan ahead about when to announce funding. If the announcement comes months or a year after closing the round, it gives the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. And, optics aside, layoffs after funding announcements (and in general) are a blow to internal morale. Doing them in a transparent and thoughtful way is crucial. </p><p>Having employees be in the know about company details, financial standing, and what the future of the company looks like might help ease the blow of layoffs. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Kline. </p><p>Being present with your staff amid layoffs, especially in a time of increased remote work, is important to let employees know you’re not disconnected and you’re listening to how layoffs impact them. </p><p>“You see a lot of situations where a founder is so preoccupied with allocating resources, talking to investors, or talking to customers, that they're spending most of their time externally and less so internally,” Kline said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Gary Gensler is keeping up with Kim Kardashian https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/kim-kardashian-emax-crypto-sec Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:23:09 +0000

Kim Kardashian <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax" target="_self">agreed to pay a $1.26 million penalty</a> for failing to report that she got paid to endorse EMAX tokens. It’s a high-profile affirmation of the SEC’s controversial position that most cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities, and just like stock promoters, celebrities better follow the rules if they want to pitch a token to the public.</p><p><strong>Disclosure rules. </strong>“Ms. Kardashian’s case” is a reminder that celebrities must “disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities" like crypto tokens, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183" target="_blank">Gensler said</a>.</p><ul><li>The SEC had actually put out this warning even before Gensler’s time in the wake of the ICO craze a few years ago. In 2017, the regulator cautioned investors <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-potentially-unlawful-promotion-icos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“to be wary of investment opportunities</a> that sound too good to be true” and of “paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons.”</li><li>The following year the SEC announced that boxer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled</a> agreed to pay “disgorgement, penalties and interest” for failing to report that they got paid for touting initial coin offerings. </li></ul><p><strong>The cases underline the perils of celebrity endorsements in the world of investment finance,</strong> where “you can't be paid to promote a stock without disclosing that you're being paid,” Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco regional director, told Protocol. </p><ul><li>Online influencers make a living on hype. But in the world of securities, “overexuberance without proper disclosures and disclaimers is going to be considered misleading and is going to get people in hot water,” Andrew Lom, global head of private wealth at Norton Rose Fulbright, told Protocol. </li><li>Mike Fasanello, chief compliance officer at LVL, said “a seasoned businesswoman like Ms. Kardashian really should have known better considering her career is built largely on advertising and her public image.”</li></ul><p><strong>It’s a significant PR moment for the SEC. </strong>While the regulator has gone after other offending crypto celebrities, the Kardashian case is a “bigger win,” Fagel argued.</p><ul><li>She’s a huge celebrity, after all, whose popularity extends beyond the crypto and finance realms. “There are a lot more people reading about Kim Kardashian” than scouring other cases and news stories involving crypto, he told Protocol. The federal government “has an interest in bringing high-profile cases as a deterrent matter because it gets a lot more attention.”</li><li>In fact, the Kardashian case “may turn into the best public service announcement not to take investment advice from a celebrity,” Bill Callahan, director of government strategic affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. It could also serve as a “warning to others that they must settle their investigations by the SEC” and other law enforcement agencies.</li><li>The fine Kardashian has to pay is “a nominal penalty considering her overall net worth,” Fasanello said. But the SEC action “is meant to educate the masses rather than to penalize the individual.”</li></ul><p>“Simply being a crypto enthusiast publicly isn't going to get anyone in trouble,” even among celebrities, Melody Brue of Moor Insights & Strategy told Protocol. In other words, Matt Damon is probably off the hook for saying that “fortune favors the brave” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crypto.com ad</a>. But trying to make money from touting crypto products is a serious matter, Brue added: “However vague you believe crypto as a security rule to be, it's clear Gensler is going to apply the same regulations, disclosure requirements, and marketing rules that are applied to securities.” </p><p><em>— Benjamin Pimentel (</em><a href="mailto:bpimentel@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="http://twitter.com/benpimentel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM ALIBABA</h3><br/><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="8959dd775f8b0d912fadd71e203ba533" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123996622&iu=/21901267728" id="daa0e" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843641&width=980"/></a><p>Alibaba — a leading global ecommerce company — is a particularly powerful engine in helping American businesses of every size sell goods to more than 1 billion consumers on its digital marketplaces in China.

The outcome could make or break an industry increasingly central to tech companies meeting their net zero goals.</p><p>Globally, Verra — short for the Verified Carbon Standard — issues roughly two-thirds of the carbon credits on the voluntary market, including credits for renewable energy and forestry and land use, among other types. Established in 2007, the registry is the longtime face of the market’s status quo.</p><p>But as demand has surged for carbon credits — particularly as the tech industry looks to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-offsets-shopping-ecommerce" target="_self">meet its net zero targets</a> by offsetting a (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/tech-climate-plan-tips?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">small</a>) portion of its emissions — it has become increasingly clear that scaling the credit market will first require clear standards and transparency. In fact, this is precisely the conclusion that forced a 400-member industry task force on scaling the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/carney-s-bid-to-boost-carbon-market-scaled-back-amid-controversy?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to change tack</a> in 2021. In its wake, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market emerged. It published proposed reforms — including establishing an agreed-upon definition for credit quality and evaluating methodologies accordingly — in July. </p><p>While Verra initially supported the effort, it has since taken issue with the specifics of even these modest potential reforms. Last week, the organization demanded that the council make a “course correction” and took particular issue with the approach that gives credit types that meet the quality definition a thumbs-up in a note to stakeholders.</p><p>“We especially fear that the principles-based review of programs has been supplanted with a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach that seeks to directly set the scope and rules of the market,” Verra wrote in mid-September. Verra also argued for program-by-program evaluation rather than one that evaluates the quality of specific credit types.</p><p>In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/verra-integrity-council" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new analysis</a>, the climate research nonprofit CarbonPlan said Verra’s objection was “melodramatic” and “about control.” </p><p>“The Integrity Council is running a voluntary, opt-in labeling effort — nothing more,” the CarbonPlan team wrote last week. “The Integrity Council isn’t proposing to do anything about credits that fall short of its standards, nor is it clear how they could if they wanted to.”</p><p>Carbon markets are essentially the Wild West. Countless methodologies exist to define what makes for a quality credit, and imposing order on any lawless frontier is proving to be a challenge. But the stakes couldn’t be higher. </p><p>A <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/reform-needed-to-unlock-550-billion-carbon-offsets-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF analysis</a> found that the carbon offset market could be worth as much as $550 billion by 2050, a time period when net zero commitments will come due. However, absent global standard-setting, it is possible that there won’t be enough quality offsets to keep up to the demand. That could mean a lot of money gets wasted on ineffective credits while causing the planet to overheat to dangerous levels. </p><p>The fact that this initial attempt does not have the support of the voluntary market’s biggest player does not bode well. CarbonPlan speculated that at the root of Verra’s objection is a concern that its credits are not “robust enough” to meet the benchmark set out by the council’s proposal, and that new standards “could threaten their dominant position on the supply side of the voluntary market.”</p><p>Verra, for its part, maintains that its concerns are with the process’s efficiency, not with its proposed scrutiny. </p><p>“We don’t wish to see good projects unable to move ahead because the methodology they are using is waiting too long in line for its assessment,” Andrew Howard, Verra’s senior director for climate policy and strategy, told Protocol. “Verra is confident the VCS program will meet the ICVCM’s quality thresholds.”</p><p>Verra proposed several specific “course corrections” for the council, ostensibly with efficiency in mind. First, it argued for evaluating entire programs rather than specific credit types or methodologies. CarbonPlan said that approach “doesn’t pass the laugh test” given that it would force the council to give the whole swath of Verra credits a thumbs-up without acknowledging how much, for instance, a renewable energy credit’s methodology might differ from that of a forestry credit. </p><p>“That is no way to confront the well-documented challenges in the voluntary carbon markets, many of which are present in Verra’s offerings, and it would force the Integrity Council to either bless most of the market uncritically or categorically exclude its largest player,” CarbonPlan said. </p><p>In response, Verra said the council should sample or use spot checks to make sure all of a program’s credit types deserve the council’s approval, but that relying on a methodology-by-methodology evaluation rather than more efficient approaches would leave the council at risk of “seriously bogged down.” </p><p>Verra also took issue with the proposal to step up standards over time and suggested that the council use existing aviation industry offset standards. Taking that approach, though, would ignore the very real need for sharper offset standards and the reality that the aviation industry’s standards are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-un-just-made-it-easier-for-airlines-to-pollute-1844251411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rife with loopholes</a>.</p><p>Regardless of what shape the council’s final reforms take, though, Verra doesn’t have to participate in the council’s proposed benchmarking if it doesn’t want to. If the registry does opt out, it would seriously undermine the scope of any new standards by making two in three carbon credits exempt. </p><p>That puts the council in the midst of a tug-of-war as Verra pulls it to change its plan and CarbonPlan and its other supporters urge it to stay the course. Should the council allow itself to be swayed by Verra’s concerns, CarbonPlan said it could put its very independence at risk.</p><p>“Either [the council members] accede to Verra’s demands and abandon any claim to independence, or they forge ahead and work with only a minority of the current market,” CarbonPlan <a href="https://twitter.com/carbonplanorg/status/1575549005265653760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summarized via Twitter</a>. “We hope they will choose the latter.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={White House AI Bill of Rights lacks specific recommendations for AI rules https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights Tue, 04 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

And, linking to an article about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveillance tech used in China</a> to track and control the Muslim minority Uyghur population there, they alluded to use of AI by autocracies “as a tool of state-sponsored oppression, division, and discrimination.”</p><p class="pull-quote">I categorically reject that kind of framing of it,” Nelson told Protocol. “The document moves as the title says from principles to practice.</p><p>Soon after the announcement, OSTP held several <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public listening sessions</a> in November 2021 on AI-enabled biometric technologies, consumer and “smart city” products, and AI used for employment, education, housing, health care, social welfare, financial services, and in the criminal justice system.</p><p>While some advocacy groups have indicated <a href="https://www.caidp.org/statements/ostp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustration with the slow process</a> for publishing the AI Bill of Rights, Nelson said by one measure — the Biden-Harris administration’s <a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Summit for Democracy</a> held in December 2021 — it is actually early. <br/><br/>“We had committed by December to finish this, and we are completing it with a little bit of time to spare,” Nelson said.</p><p>Scandal has plagued OSTP this year. Former OSTP Director <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/eric-lander-resigns-00006545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lander resigned In February</a> amid accusations he created “an atmosphere of intimidation at OSTP through flagrant verbal abuse.” Later in March, POLITICO revealed that Lander had helped enable an organization led by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to pay the salaries of some OSTP staff.<br/><br/></a>Lawmakers have proposed legislation that would take ethical commitments made by the government out of the realm of theory and into practice. Legislation introduced in February, for example, would <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/revised-algorithmic-accountability-bill-ai" target="_self">require companies to assess the impact of AI</a> and automated systems they use to make decisions affecting people’s employment, finances, and housing and require those companies to submit annual reports about assessments to the FTC.</p><p>Despite a lack of federal AI laws or regulations, the U.S. has agreed to uphold international <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles established in 2019 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> that call on makers and users of AI systems to be held accountable for them, and ensure they respect human rights and democratic values including privacy, non-discrimination, fairness, and labor rights. Those principles also called on AI builders and users to make sure that the systems are transparent, provide understandable and traceable explanations for their decisions, and are safe and secure.</p><p>In conjunction with the publication of the AI Bill of Rights, other federal agencies are expected to signal commitment to take actions reflective of its tenets. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services plans to release recommendations for methods to reduce algorithmic discrimination in health care AI and the Department of Education is planning to release recommendations on the use of AI for teaching and learning by early 2023.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The US is set to expand controls on chip tech for China this week https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/us-china-chips-export-controls Mon, 03 Oct 2022 23:01:22 +0000

Thursday’s announcement is expected to include export controls on chipmaking tools.</p><p>In late August, Nvidia and AMD disclosed they had received notification letters from the Commerce Department ordering them to halt sales of chips designed for artificial intelligence computing.

High-bandwidth memory (which is useful for training large AI models) and flash were among the memory technologies under consideration, the people said. </p><p>Administration officials had been briefed by several memory manufacturers about establishing specific thresholds for flash and high-bandwidth memory, according to another person familiar with the discussions.

The stakes for the legal status quo underpinning the entirety of modern social media are potentially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/texas-elon-musk-free-speech?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">huge</a>, and the outcome is far from certain.</p><p><strong>The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/supreme-court-scrutinize-us-protections-social-media-2022-10-03/" target="_blank">said</a> it will hear <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gonzalez-v-google-llc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a case</a> involving terrorist content on YouTube and whether or not Section 230 immunizes platforms’ algorithms.</strong></p><ul><li>Section 230, of course, says that web platforms, from newspaper comment sections and email providers to Big Tech platforms like Google, can’t be sued over posts that are “provided by another” — a.k.a., by users.</li><li>One of the many, many questions swirling around this law is, when do platforms become so involved with the content that they cease to be separate from users, and can be sued?</li><li>Is it when they were alerted to content by user reports? How about when they promote the content through algorithms? When they add their own warning about it?</li></ul><p><strong>Up until now, federal districts and appeals courts have basically ruled “no” to all of the above,</strong> reasoning that if any were the case, platforms would have to either check almost every single post or ignore all of them.</p><ul><li>Both extremes would be bad for business — a big concern at the dawn of the internet age, in 1996, when the law passed.</li><li>Checking every post (and taking down all the ones that raise any worry of even frivolous litigation) obviously would be bad for free speech.</li><li>But creating a free-for-all would make platforms intensely toxic. The moderation that platforms <em>do</em> do is both arguably both <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/meta-midterms-global-democracy-2023" target="_self">insufficient</a> and also the only thing making some platforms tolerable. </li></ul><p>Under that legal approach, the algorithms that order and recommend content — which, from a technological point of view, are basically the entire point and purpose of social media — <strong>don’t create lawsuit risk for the platforms.</strong></p><ul><li>Nor do fact-checks, labels, failures to act on warnings, and lots of other things.</li><li>It’s not just takedowns and other forms of moderation: Leaving content up and doing nothing with it is also completely fine, under the law.</li></ul><p>Of course, <strong>there’s bipartisan anger that this setup creates huge levels of harm without recourse for those who got hurt, even as some tech companies have gotten very rich.</strong></p><ul><li>Much of that anger focuses on harm that happens at algorithmic scale — whether it’s the spread of child sexual abuse material or mass harassment — because of boosting by Big Tech companies’ very <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/design-wars-ca" target="_self">own</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/california-privacy-transparency?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">designs</a>.</li><li>The case — and an additional case the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/twitter-inc-v-taamneh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will hear</a> involving Twitter — involves terrorist content and attacks, and could offer SCOTUS the ability to narrow court interpretation about just how free social services are to be, well, what they are.</li><li>There may be <a href="https://twitter.com/jkosseff/status/1576934189643239424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real appetite</a> for that kind of narrowing, in fact: The justices appear to have taken up the issue despite the lack of any disagreement in circuit courts, which is more often what <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/section-230-snap" target="_self">prompts</a> them to hear a case.</li></ul><p>By the way, if you thought it was a different issue that touched on Section 230 and seemed <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/hb20-fifth-circuit-stay" target="_self">destined for the Supreme Court</a> — namely,<strong> whether states can require platforms to host conservative content — the justices still could take that up too.</strong></p><p><strong>Both sets of cases create huge uncertainty for tech, though of course a ruling confirming the status quo is possible in both.</strong></p><ul><li>The court may also decide to rule narrowly and only find a small loophole for existing statutes on terrorist content.</li><li>Maybe the justices will follow the framing of the Twitter case and sidestep algorithms altogether, focusing instead on liability in anti-terrorism law.</li><li>But the breadth of potential questions is staggering here, including free speech and design.</li></ul><p>And unlike most of the contentious issues, where the ideological lineup of the court is a good predictor of the outcome, <strong>Section 230 has <a href="https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1576933341894705152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foes</a> and defenders on both sides, and for the most part, we don’t know where the nine justices fall.</strong></p><ul><li>The one exception is arch-conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-section-230" target="_self">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-230-meta" target="_self">called</a> for narrowing when companies get to benefit from the law and for expanding the circumstances where they’re responsible for content.</li></ul><p>I wrote a few weeks ago that the possibility of the Supreme Court taking up the Florida and Texas laws had a real “<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/texas-scotus-issues?rebelltitem=4" target="_self">season finale</a>” vibe — no one knows what’s going to happen and seemingly everything is on the table.

Microsoft Solutions Partners also can earn specializations and expert program status that recognize their expertise and experience in specific technical scenarios under each solution area. </p><p>“What I think is unique about the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is it gives customers total clarity on the partner that has the designations, the specializations that are a great fit for their needs for whatever unique cloud solutions they’re looking for or the transformation that they’re trying to get after,” Dezen said. “It’s like a clear road map, so to speak.”</p><p>A 12-year Microsoft veteran, Dezen most recently served as corporate vice president of device partner sales.

What this means for partners is that they get to differentiate themselves in a very competitive market to customers.</p><p>It’s a really important moment to showcase to partners that we are evolving … as the market is evolving, and we are introducing new capabilities in our programs that let partners focus on their own innovation, leverage our R&D investments, and help customers. The program makes it very easy for partners to understand the things that they need to do to activate all of the resources that we uniquely deliver to partners, whether that’s our R&D investments, our go-to-market scale and capability, or innovation.</p><p>Partners can plug in via skilling, incentives, [or] investments to make sure that they’re getting the best of what I think is Microsoft’s unique differentiation, which is our tech stack plus the combination of the way we go to market, which is the asset of our commercial marketplace combined with our 35,000 [Microsoft field] sellers.</p><p><strong>What’s been the reaction among partners?</strong></p><p>We’ve spent the last six months talking to partners, listening to their feedback, answering their questions. I’m really optimistic that the partners are excited about what we’re doing. They’re excited about the [timing] of this. They see that the portfolio of assets that we’re bringing together with a trusted platform, services, products, and investments for them are so aligned to the way that customers are actually buying products. And it’s aligned to the way that Microsoft sells, so it’s an accelerant for the partners.</p><p><strong>What percentage of partners have decided to join the new program versus renewing their legacy statuses for a year?</strong></p><p>We’re not disclosing specific numbers, but what I will say is partners have the ability to start earning designations immediately. And for partners that aren’t quite ready — first of all, we’re leaning in with resources to help partners make that shift — but they can continue to enjoy their competency benefits uninterrupted through their annual term. They can even renew those benefits after the Silver and Gold badges have retired.</p><p>When Microsoft announced the new program in March, it said partners’ preliminary partner capability scores would be available then, and they had to achieve at least 70 points out of 100 to earn a designation. What percentage of partners needed Microsoft’s help in getting to 70 points?</p><p>Every partner is in a different place on their journey. We have broad-reaching guidance through our partner center that tells partners exactly how they can improve their score in the different categories: performance, skilling, and customer success. Partners can start earning those designations immediately. There are some partners that are well on their way. </p><p>Partners still remain our partners regardless of their designation, and so we’re always going to look for ways to support our partners through any evolutions that are happening with us and in the market. I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are. But I really believe that this program is the thing that’s going to differentiate partners, and so it’s in our interest, in our partners’ interest, and frankly, in the customers’ interests, for partners to lean in and do this work with us.</p><p><strong>The economy has tumbled since Microsoft announced the changes that take effect today. Were any considerations given to partners that might be experiencing economic challenges?</strong></p><p>I actually think the time is better than ever. This is a challenging market, there’s no question about it, but customers need help. They need help to digitally transform, and it’s in their economic interest to do that. We’re giving partners the skills, the resources, the assets, and the partnership to enable them to show customers how they can run their businesses more cost-effectively digitally.</p><p class="pull-quote">I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the changes coming with the industry designations for ISVs?</strong></p><p>There are actually two immediate investments that we’re making around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/program-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ISV Success</a>, which is the pathway for ISVs within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, and then the industry designations. Those are going to be available later this year. They will differentiate solutions based on the demonstrated performance with customers, their technical maturity, and customer success. The first three industries are health care, retail, and financial services. It’s designed with the intent that it will help these ISVs differentiate their solutions by both industry-specific scenarios as well as the broader technology and line-of-business capabilities.</p><p><strong>Can you give a sneak peek of anything else that’s coming after these changes?</strong></p><p>The way to think about it is the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is designed for every partner. We want to invite every partner to participate in it. So the things that you could expect to see in the future are more design capabilities for partners like device partners, mixed-reality partners, learning partners, success partners. We’ll have more specific capabilities roll out as we advance the program.</p><p><strong>What are some common problems or challenges that partners have communicated to you?</strong></p><p>Partners are deciding how quickly they can evolve and modernize their businesses. That’s pretty core to the discussions that we have with partners all the time: How can we help them? How can we help them make more money? How can we help them run thriving, profitable businesses to help their own employees?</p><p>We just published [Microsoft-commissioned research] <a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/microsoft-ecosystem-value-new-data-reveals-partner-paths-to-profitability-and-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from IDC</a>. It’s a great illustration: It talks about how partners that invest with Microsoft see distinct business value and growth. There’s really two things that popped for me. One was that partners that engage deeply with Microsoft see faster growth and higher margins. Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year. The second one is around co-selling and going to market with us. The research showed that the most successful partners we have are engaging across the variety of go-to-market resources with us. These are partners that develop differentiated, value-added approaches to customers that align with Microsoft’s strategy. </p><p class="pull-quote">Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year.</p><p><strong>Are there any emerging technology areas where you’d like to see more partners investing in?</strong></p><p>I’d like to see more partners in all of our solution areas. The party’s open. There are some things that are very timely: certainly security, data, and AI. These are very hot and relevant topics for customers right now, and so that’s pretty core to the conversations that we’re having with our partners.</p><p><strong>Are you going to get involved in trying to bring more female-led partners into the program and promoting greater diversity overall?</strong></p><p>I have a massive responsibility to be a loud voice for diversity and representation in the ecosystem. Any things that we can do to help more diverse partner types participate in our programs, build their own businesses with Microsoft, and then help customers, for me that’s not just a professional win, it’s a personal one.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Tech recruiters' best tips for sourcing talent on LinkedIn https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/best-practices-linkedin-talent-sourcing Mon, 03 Oct 2022 16:54:39 +0000

Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p><hr/><p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul><p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul><p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul><p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul></ul><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Kim Kardashian will pay $1.26 million over crypto post, SEC says https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax Mon, 03 Oct 2022 13:05:05 +0000

Since then the landscape for productivity startups trying to make it on their own has completely changed, especially for those pandemic darlings that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=16f2286b6490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flourished in the all-remote world</a>. </p><p>As recession looms, companies looking to cut costs are less likely to spend money on tools outside of their Microsoft or Google workplace bundles. Enterprise platforms are bulking up and it could spell trouble for the productivity startups trying to unseat them. But Notion COO Akshay Kothari says the company is still aiming to build the next Microsoft, not be the next Microsoft. And in a move signaling a new chapter of maturity, Notion has hired its first chief financial officer: Rama Katkar, Instacart’s former VP of finance.</p><p>Figma, which Kothari called a “sister company” to Notion, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/adobe-to-acquire-figma" target="_self">decided to join Adobe</a> for $20 billion instead of beating them. But Notion is hungry for more. Unlike other startups that have pared down during the downturn, Notion has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-flowdash-acquisition-tender-offer" target="_self">gone on the offensive</a> with acquisitions of calendar app Cron and workflow app Flowdash, as well as launching a global ad campaign. Notion also retained its valuation after <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sequoia-index-purchase-shares-from-notion-employees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees sold shares to investors in a tender offer</a>. Kothari said he doesn’t feel Notion has to “entertain any discussions” about being acquired; there’s more room for Notion to grow, he said, both in the consumer and enterprise spaces. </p><p>“It's almost not worth thinking about the hypotheticals because there's just so much that is left to be done, that we could do ourselves,” Kothari said. </p><h3>IPO or no? </h3><p>Katkar’s hire is a sign Notion may even go public in the near future. The CFO has some experience in this area (Katkar prepped Instacart for its impending, and lately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instacart-plans-to-focus-ipo-on-selling-employee-shares-11663581602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat troubled</a>, IPO.) When Protocol asked about Notion’s IPO plans, she didn’t commit to a “yes” or “no.” Instead, Katkar said Notion is “focused on building” and tackling the international knowledge worker market. </p><p>Whenever a late-stage private company hires a CFO, that means they’re thinking about “the next step,” Wing Venture Capital partner Zach DeWitt said. Going public is typically this next step, and so hiring a CFO with public company or IPO-readiness experience is the way to go. “Usually around $5 million of revenue is when a company starts talking about a VP of finance,” DeWitt said. “By the time the company has $50 million of ARR, they should definitely have a CFO, in the majority of cases.”</p><p>At Instacart and before that at Credit Karma, Katkar developed the financial processes and functions necessary for a maturing company. These IPO-readiness skills apply to private companies too, she noted. </p><p>“That concept of public company readiness is just a framework,” Katkar said. “But in reality, I think even large private companies benefit from operating that way.”</p><p>Katkar was the No. 2 financial officer at both Instacart and Credit Karma, and she feels ready to take on the CFO role. Notion was at the top of her list for its simultaneous consumer and enterprise focus, Katkar said. </p><h3>B to C to B</h3><p>Kothari describes Notion as a “B2C2B” company. Notion doesn’t target CIOs, but rather consumers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-conference-enterprise-productivity-influencer" target="_self">who then work to formalize Notion</a> inside their companies, the so-called <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/cio-shadow-it-saas" target="_self">shadow IT</a> or, in Notion world, “Notion Champions.” Lately, Notion has been working on making its product more translatable for large companies, adding <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-08-29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more admin controls and specific workspaces for teams</a>. But Kothari said he’s not forcing Notion into the enterprise at this point. </p><p>“Eventually, we'll get to a point where we can actually go up to the CIO of a company, who's never heard of Notion, and convince them to roll out Notion company-wide,” Kothari said. “But most of the work right now is happening through the employees, through the community.”</p><p>Notion’s ad campaign, with billboards in London, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco, emphasizes the note-taking tool’s ability to help organize personal life, not just work. Kothari also pointed to the company’s New York City and San Francisco pop-up stands offering bucket hats and coffee as part of the broader brand campaign. This type of branding, as well as the company’s investment in and popularity on TikTok, helps target Gen Z and students who might become Notion worker-champions someday. </p><p>“We can put our energy into making sure our consumers get to use the product for free because we know that downstream, that leads to a B2B business being built in the long run,” Kothari said. </p><p>But Notion’s B2B approach is ultimately not as strong when going up against enterprise software giants with stronger distribution models. DeWitt pointed out that Notion’s valuation is similar to Figma’s at $10 billion, making it a potential candidate for a lucrative acquisition someday. “I’m sure there are some large companies, like Microsoft would be a natural buyer here, maybe even Salesforce, that are thinking about potentially acquiring Notion,” DeWitt said. “It’s a great category, a great team, a great product. It’s got a lot of momentum.”</p><p>Kothari said he feels a close kinship with Figma, as the two companies had similar growth trajectories and similar <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/adobe-figma-dylan-field-user-reactions" target="_self">obsessive, loyal user bases</a>. He’s known CEO Dylan Field for over a decade. The Adobe deal shows “how much existing legacy companies really appreciate the power of these new businesses,” Kothari said. </p><p>Kothari has been through acquisitions twice, with LinkedIn buying his content platform Pulse, and then Microsoft buying LinkedIn. Kothari said it’s not in the cards for Notion, at least not right now. </p><p>“When [Notion CEO] Ivan was recruiting me, he said, do you want to work at Microsoft or do you want to build the next Microsoft?” Kothari said. “I’m personally excited about continuing to build here and seeing if we can continue to remain independent.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Securing the enterprise https://www.protocol.com/manuals/securing-the-enterprise/ Mon, 03 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

Another 23% have too thin a credit file to score or no file at all. That puts them in a credit trap: To build credit, these consumers need someone to give them a line of credit with which they can demonstrate good financial habits. But with scores that low, few lenders are prepared to offer them anything. </p><p>Neobanks say they can solve the problem through a new twist on secured credit cards. But regulators are already scrutinizing their offerings.</p><p>Secured credit cards have been an answer to the thin-credit problem <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/build-credit-with-secured-credit-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for decades</a> because they allow subprime borrowers to open a line of credit when they otherwise can’t by depositing cash upfront. That sum determines the borrower’s credit limit, and gives the banks collateral to hold on to in case of default. However, most require several hundred dollars as a deposit and impose <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp#:~:text=Secured%20credit%20cards%20generally%20come,lower%2Dcost%20forms%20of%20credit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty interest rates and fees</a>, which low-income borrowers struggle to afford.</p><h3>Payback time?</h3><p>Neobanks say they can avoid those problems and still help users build credit through secured credit cards that allow customers to repay their credit balance directly using their deposited cash, rather than keeping that money set aside. The products allow customers to build credit while paying for everyday expenses, neobanks say, without having to save up extra cash first. </p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank describe it as a win-win for consumers and fintechs — consumers can raise their credit scores, and the neobanks earn loyal customers. </p><p>But some in the industry see red flags. “They are, functionally, prepaid credit cards,” fintech analyst Alex Johnson told Protocol. That raises the concern that neobanks may be helping users increase their credit score with a tool that doesn't actually indicate their ability to repay. “If I was a lender, I’d be pissed about having to untangle the trade lines in these consumers’ credit files in order to make sure I wasn’t mistakenly granting credit to high-risk applicants.”</p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards each have similar mechanics: First, a user moves money from a checking account into a separate credit-builder account. The amount of money they move determines their credit limit: If a user moves $200 into the credit-builder account, they can spend up to $200 on a linked secured credit card. Then, at the end of the payment period, users can pay off their credit card balances with the money they’ve deposited — in this example, that same $200. Both Varo and Chime also allow users to sign up for automatic payments. </p><p>Varo and GO2bank told Protocol that it’s that third step — having to pay off the credit card at the end of the payment period — that makes the cards credit cards, not prepaid debit cards. Late payment or failure to repay can damage users’ credit scores. GO2bank additionally charges up to $39 for a late payment. Chime declined to answer any questions for this story. </p><p>With this distinction, neobanks are subject to regulations that govern credit but not debit cards, like the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_truth-in-lending-act.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth in Lending Act</a>. They also, crucially, can market the cards as credit-building tools. The companies make 1% to 2% more in interchange on credit cards than they do on debit cards, <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-marshall-introduce-bipartisan-credit-card-competition-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though pending legislation</a> may curb these fees.</p><p>Visa, on whose network Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards are issued, did not respond to questions about whether the cards resemble prepaid debit cards. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion also did not respond to questions about whether the cards accurately indicate customers’ ability to repay. </p><p>Varo and Go2Bank both say they are not worried about pending legislation changing the amount they can charge on interchange because the credit-building products are not a core source of profit. Rather, representatives of both banks told Protocol the product serves to help them meet customer needs and thus build goodwill with their users. “We’re building deeper connections and deeper engagement,” Raktim Mitra, Varo’s head of credit cards, told Protocol. </p><p>The CFPB acknowledged Varo and Chime’s secured credit-builder products in its <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-credit-card-market-report_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Consumer Credit Card Market Report</a>, without mentioning whether the products might deserve further scrutiny. When Protocol asked the bureau for an update on its views, a spokesperson said that “the CFPB is aware of this market development, and we are monitoring this issue closely.” </p><h3>A spot of ambiguity</h3><p>For consumer advocates, the ambiguity around such programs is a symptom of a larger problem: The CFPB has yet to bring neobanks fully under its regulatory purview. Under the law that created it, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-examinations/institutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bureau can supervise</a> financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets and certain participants in consumer financial markets, like those that work in consumer reporting, debt collection, or the servicing of some loans. </p><p>The bureau invoked a dormant authority to investigate nonbank fintechs in April of this year, though consumer advocates <a href="https://consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFPB-CFA%20Fact-Sheet-CFPB-and-non-banks.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been advocating</a> for more regular and thorough supervision. “There’s no accountability as of right now,” said Rachel Gittleman, head of financial services outreach at the Consumer Federation of America. </p><p>Gittleman’s primary concern with the credit-builders is that consumers may not understand they are using a lending product, despite the terms and conditions laid out in fine print. Though Chime, Varo, and GO2bank each market their products explicitly as secured credit cards, they <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/varo-bank-introduces-varo-believe-a-new-and-better-way-for-millions-of-americans-to-build-credit-301235475.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downplay</a> possible negative impacts on a customer’s credit, and automatic payment options make the products feel more like a regular debit card that doesn’t have default risk.

Today, we’re learning the best ways to source talent on LinkedIn — especially if you’re short on time and resources (read: recruiters). Plus, we’re reading Elon’s text messages from Larry Ellison, Jason Calicanis, and Joe Rogan.</em></p><p class=""><em>— Allison Levitsky, reporter (</em><a href="mailto:alevitsky@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Levitskyyy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>LinkedIn recruiting secrets</h3><br/><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/technology/meta-hiring-freeze.html" target="_blank">Meta</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/27/lyft-freezes-all-us-hiring-amid-stock-slump-economic-downturn/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> have stopped hiring for the year, and that’s music to the ears of other tech companies that are still staffing up. Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p>
<p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><h3>'Haha cool'</h3><br/><p>The world got a glimpse into Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" target="_blank">text inbox</a> this week thanks to his ongoing legal battle with Twitter. Now we know what tech’s power brokers really want: for Twitter to be an “open source protocol” rather than a company (Jack Dorsey), for Musk to move Twitter’s headquarters to Austin and force employees back to the office (Jason Calacanis), and a 24-hour edit button (Gayle King).</p>
<p>Larry Ellison, Reid Hoffman, and Joe Rogan are in there, too. </p>

So what’s next? According to Miller, the next era, including the rivalry between the U.S. and China, is all about computing power.</p><p>That tech rivalry and the story of how the chip industry got from four to 11.8 billion transistors are all part of Miller’s book, “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” which comes out Oct. 4. “Chip War” outlines the nature of the coming battle over semiconductors, showing how the power to produce leading-edge chips fell into the hands of just five companies: three from the U.S., one from Japan, and one from the Netherlands. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Miller touched on the evolving military uses of semiconductors, Russia’s chip procurement problems, and whether onshoring chips won’t necessarily increase the likelihood of a conflict between the U.S. and China. </p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>You write about how the Persian Gulf War became a pivotal moment for understanding the role microchips would play in warfare, especially with guided missiles. Are missiles still the use-case where the military needs the most advanced chips, or has that shifted to other areas like artificial intelligence or cyber attacks?</strong></p><p>I wouldn't necessarily think about individual weapon systems. Chips are important in those weapon systems, but there's also the broader integration of sensors to decision-makers, communication technologies, [and] weapon systems — all of which rely on chips of different sorts. </p><p>So it's the integration that matters as much as the capabilities of any individual system. But as more and more systems start to become more autonomous, the demands for computing power, memory, and communication bandwidth increase on all of these systems. </p><p>So yes, semiconductors are still very important in terms of advances in specific types of munitions, but it's also [about] the ability to integrate them, to transfer information between them, and to have them working together — and all that requires advanced semiconductors at every stage of the process. Militaries are confronting semiconductors everywhere they turn, and their ability to access the right types of semiconductors and more advanced chips is crucial for every aspect of the modern battlefield.</p><p><strong>What’s Russia’s status with the ability to procure semiconductors? There were reports that Russia was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-chips-are-down-russia-hunts-western-parts-to-run-its-war-machines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggling to access</a> chips for the Ukraine conflict. </strong></p><p>Russia does have some domestic chipmaking capacity but it's very, very limited, both in terms of the level of advancement — which is not that advanced — but also in terms of capacity. </p><p>What we've learned from the war — which confirms what we presumed before the war — is that, when you take apart the Russian military system, you'll find lots of foreign-produced chips, and often American-produced chips, inside. Many of these chips are off the shelf — things that you can acquire commercially.</p><p>In some ways, the fact that every military in the world is trying to use commercial chips in their systems has been an equalizing factor. But for Russia, it has presented some challenges too. Russia never really knows whether the chips it's buying have been sabotaged in any way. Every country has that to a certain extent. But the U.S., for example, is relying on chip fabs in the U.S. or in friendly countries — whereas Russia is relying almost exclusively on chips produced in unfriendly countries.</p><p>The systems integration capabilities are also lacking in Russia. They've got some, but there's just a lot more expertise in places like the U.S. or in East Asian countries [for] how you bring different types of chips plus software plus the hardware all together in a coherent system. And I think that's also somewhere we've seen Russia face some difficulties.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo courtesy of Chris Miller</small></p><p><strong>How successful do you think the Chips Plus Act will be? </strong></p><p>There's a question about getting the most bang for our buck out of the Chips Act fund. I think there are ways we can get more or less lucky on that front. But I don't think there's really a serious argument that the Chips Act funding is not going to increase the amount of leading-edge chipmaking capacity in the U.S. We've already seen a number of new facilities being built on the expectations of those funds.</p><p><strong>Does onshoring chip production increase the chances of conflict between the U.S. and China? It seems the U.S. is onshoring production in anticipation of greater conflict, but is it also possible it increases the chances of something happening by reducing the cost of conflict?</strong></p><p>This sort of mutually assured economic destruction thesis — the idea that the U.S. and China or China and Taiwan could never find themselves in a conflict because it would be too costly to do — I think history provides many examples of times in which economically integrated countries ended up in conflict. So that's one reason to be skeptical of it.</p><p>The second reason is that the assumption that was true for most of the period from Deng Xiaoping forward in China — that Chinese leaders were primarily focused on maximizing GDP — that assumption is no longer valid. The last three years of Chinese policy have not been about maximizing GDP but about political goals and zero COVID. It doesn't mean that they're not going to care at all about economic issues. But we shouldn't assume that either China or the U.S. or Taiwan is approaching these issues solely from the perspective of making sure trading continues unharmed.</p><p>The lesson of 2022 is not that economically integrated powers can't quickly decouple, because we've seen that in a shocking way between Russia and Europe. So I don't think we should take much comfort in the fact that there's a lot of economic integration between China, Taiwan, the U.S., and other countries in the sense that is going to guarantee a peaceful outcome. I don't think history suggests that's true.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Big Tech’s facade is crumbling https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/hiring-freeze-downturn-big-tech Sun, 02 Oct 2022 10:00:00 +0000

As part of this, we occasionally reprioritize the roles we need to fill and offer similar roles to candidates with pending offers,” the company told Protocol in an emailed statement. </li><li>Privately, sources say the environment has changed noticeably across the company, with a clear focus on cost-cutting. </li><li>And Amazon isn’t alone.

Yes, there were respectable amenities, like big cafeterias and workout centers. But employees weren’t getting massages, napping in pods, or swilling Kombucha on tap. </li><li>Then Silicon Valley came along and changed the paradigm. The can-do, entrepreneurial vibe was matched with enviable perks that helped make a job in tech the decade’s hottest LinkedIn accessory. </li></ul><p><strong>Now, industry leaders are left to grapple with the beast they created. </strong>And it’s somehow a surprise to them that after decades of insane perks, employees are <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/anti-perks-benefits-corporate-culture" target="_self">pushing back</a> on efforts to curtail those benefits. </p><ul><li>“‘We shouldn’t always equate fun with money,” Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-infamously told employees</a>.

It’s officially spooky season.</em></p><p><em>This week in the startup world: VCs rethink the office, inside the Twitter deal-making, and Cloudflare tries to woo startups.</em></p><h3>VCs rethink where — and what — their office spaces are </h3><br/><p>In the pre-pandemic times, Contrary’s network of venture scouts, founders, and top technologists reflected the magnetic pull Silicon Valley had on the tech industry. About 80% were based in the Bay Area, with a smattering living elsewhere. Today, when Contrary asked where people in its network were living, the split had changed with 40% in the Bay Area and another 40% living in or planning to move to New York.</p><p>It’s totally bifurcated now, said Contrary’s founder Eric Tarczynski. “That was a big wake-up call for us. Before the pandemic, New York wasn’t even really on the road map,” Tarczynski said. “A huge cross-section of engineers are now in New York.”</p><p><strong>Sand Hill Road is losing its shine as more VCs rethink where they’re located. </strong>That’s not to say the Bay Area is over (I’d argue far from it). But cities like New York are still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/09/every-firm-is-talking-about-it-venture-capital-is-having-its-new-york-moment/?sh=5f6b0e487fa3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“having their moment”</a> and continue to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2022-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grow in share of venture deals</a> over the Bay Area. </p><ul><li>In the last year, venture firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed have added offices in New York City. </li><li>Check-writing partners for Greylock and Threshold VC moved to NYC, while other firms have stealthily set up shop with small teams working out of WeWorks. Even the reporters covering Silicon Valley <a href="https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1574490494918443042" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are moving to NYC</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>There’s another strategy change afoot. </strong>More venture firms are experimenting with building community spaces instead of more offices for their partners to work out of. </p><ul><li>In New York, Tarczynski’s venture firm built Contrary NYC, a space that’s meant to be like <a href="https://www.protocol.com/contrary-nyc-founder-space" target="_self">a Soho House for techies</a> (minus the pool, restaurants, and hotel rooms). It’s supposed to evoke the feel of a club where engineers and entrepreneurs can hang out together, have a space to work, and host events for people in tech. In the last few weeks, there have been female founder dinners, comedy shows, and an appearance by Serena Williams at a launch party for startup Parfait held at Contrary NYC. </li><li>In Los Angeles, Brianne Kimmel’s Worklife fund opened up its new <a href="https://www.worklife.vc/studios/silverlake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worklife Studios</a> space in the Silver Lake neighborhood. She advertises the space as a location where “Discords and DAOs can host events, remote workers can meet new people, and anyone can enjoy our eclectic schedule of gatherings — from dinner parties with the neighborhood to album listening parties with artists.” This past weekend, a thousand people <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1573382493616877569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were waiting in line</a> to get into its space: The band Wallows was doing a pop-up merch store.</li></ul><strong>Part of it is finding a tribe outside of Silicon Valley. </strong>In SF, it can be frustratingly homogenous with many people working in and around the tech industry. In NY and LA, there’s more diversity and with that more opportunity for VCs to step in and be that beacon for the tech communities in a way that’s not as needed in a market like the Bay Area. “For the past 20 or 30 years, SF was the only game in town,” Tarczynski said. “Having a little bit more distribution and even talent flow is frankly pretty good for the venture community.”<h3>Overheard</h3><br/><p><strong>“This makes it seem like I’m desperate. Please stop,” </strong>Elon Musk texted angel investor Jason Calacanis over his promotion of an SPV to buy Twitter shares. Court filings filled with Elon Musk’s texts this week showed the fascinating network of relationships and power brokers that surround Musk in this deal — and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players" style="" target="_self">the things that they’re angling for</a>. Steve Jurvetson suggested Emil Michael for the job of CEO, but Musk shot it down in favor of someone with actual software experience. Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman both signed off to invest billions via text. Calacanis had the most interesting relationship with Musk, sending off ideas about charging people, forcing employees back to the office, and even throwing his name in the ring for CEO. Musk asked if he wanted to be an adviser, and Calacanis replied “Board member, advisor, whatever.” “[Y]ou have my sword.” That tone changed later on when Musk appeared miffed at Calacanis after Morgan Stanley and Musk employee Jared Birchall were “very upset” with the way Calacanis was running the deal and that he was taking advantage of his friendship with Musk. “Only ever want to support you,” Calacanis replied <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">in the texts</a>. </p><p><strong></strong><strong>“Some of the business practices don’t rise to the level of ethics that we’re all used to in private equity with your investors and your customers and your community, and that has been a bit disappointing,”</strong> said Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo in a rebuke of the crypto industry. After buying shares in FTX and a handful of other crypto companies, the private equity billionaire <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c5dd6c35-d3e2-4602-a8e4-54266990cfd3?tpcc=nltermsheet" target="_blank">told the FT</a> that he’s backing off investing in the crypto market for now despite remaining long-term bullish on the sector.</p><strong>“When my friend asks if I want to invest, of course I’m going to kick in $10,000 — it’s a way to stay connected, an excuse to get updates,” </strong>an anonymous startup founder <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/silicon-valley-turns-angel-investing-into-a-social-currency" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a>.

Gavin Newsom signed into law a <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20212022/SB1008/" target="_blank">bill</a> that makes phone calls from California’s prisons free of charge. The new law places the cost of calls not on incarcerated people — or the people receiving calls from them — but on the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p><p>California is the second state after Connecticut and the biggest state by far to institute such a law, which is a direct shot at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-cost-prison-communications-driving-debt-racial-wealth-gap-2021-6" target="_blank">$1.4 billion prison telecom industry</a>. For years prison telecom companies have maintained rates that “can be unjustly and unreasonably high, thereby impeding the ability of inmates and their loved ones to maintain vital connections,” the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-takes-next-big-steps-reducing-inmate-calling-rates" target="_blank">said</a> in 2020. </p><p>Prison reform advocates argue the new California law will have a hugely positive impact on the families of incarcerated people in California — and potentially other states that follow California's lead.  <span></span></p><hr/><p>"From a public policy perspective,  we should be wanting people to stay connected to their social networks, to their families, to be able to start looking for employment if they are close to getting out," said state Sen. Josh Becker, who sponsored the bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1008" target="_blank">SB 1008</a>. "But we have a very perverse system, which inhibits that and actually throws many families into debt."</p><p>For years, the high cost of prison phone calls has sapped money from low-income families with incarcerated loved ones. According to <a href="https://ellabakercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-Pays-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 report</a> by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, 34% of families go into debt in their attempt to maintain contact with loved ones inside through phone calls and visitations. The impact is disproportionately felt by women of color, because of the corresponding disproportionate number of men of color in America’s prisons.</p><p>Now, with the governor's blessing, "the simple cost of a call is never going to impair their ability to tell their children they love them or help their partner problem-solve a parenting situation,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a prison reform organization, which was a key player in advocating for the bill.</p><p>The new law covers the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2022/09/Tpop1d220928.pdf" target="_blank">93,000 incarcerated people</a> in the state's prison system, and Becker hopes future legislation will extend free calls into California's city and county jails, as well.</p><p>In addition to making calls free to users, the law prohibits local agencies from “receiving revenue for the provision of communication services to persons in its custody." The law also charges the state’s utility commission with ensuring service does not fall below standard, now that calls are free. Proponents of the law say the policy change will cost California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-23/prison-jail-communication-california-senate-bill-1008" target="_blank">about $12 million annually</a>, but that is a small fraction of the <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4517" target="_blank">$14.2 billion budget for the state’s corrections department</a>.</p><p>In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has tried to clamp down on the astronomical costs charged by prison telecom providers including slashing fees and capping rates at 21 cents per minute for interstate calls in 2013. More recently, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-improved-communications-access-incarcerated-people" target="_blank">adopted</a> a rule to prevent prison phone companies from seizing pre-paid funds from users, after one prison telecom giant, GTL, was found to have <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/fcc-gtl" target="_blank">seized</a> $121 million in customer funds. Other local governments have notched their own victories in the fight against sky-high prison call rates. In 2019, New York became the first major city jail system to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/connecticut-free-prison-phone-calls-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">make calls free</a>. In 2020, San Francisco also made phone calls from its jails free and <a href="https://sfgov.org/financialjustice/newsletters/san-francisco-announces-all-phone-calls-county-jails-are-now-free" target="_blank">announced a policy change</a> that would "permanently stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families through phone calls."</p><p>But advocates are hopeful that California's law will set an example for other state governments, because of the sheer size of its prison population. “California has a much bigger system,  and what it does matters to the rest of the corrections community,” Tylek said. “It will be a huge trendsetter for everyone else.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Great products come from strong patents https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/great-products-are-built-on-strong-patents Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000

</p><p>In today’s knowledge-based economy, IP rights play a foundational role. “Core R&D is the first step in getting good products into people’s hands,” said John Smee, senior VP of engineering and global head of wireless research at Qualcomm.<em> “</em>Everything from smartphones to the Internet of Things, automotive and industrial innovation begins as a breakthrough within our research labs.” At Qualcomm, Smee said, strong IP laws help the company confidently conduct cutting-edge 5G and 6G wireless research that will make its way into products ranging from everyday consumer goods to the factory floor. </p><p>Semiconductor companies, in particular, are fiercely protective of their IP because it’s their primary competitive advantage. Chip companies go to extraordinary lengths to protect their IP by maintaining black boxes only accessible to one person per fab, choosing highly secure operating locations, and keeping R&D teams separate from fab operations teams.</p><p>On the legal side, America’s Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 bestows legal protection of chip topography and design layout IP while the EU’s Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products of 1986 protects IC design. These regulations “have encouraged firms to continue to innovate,” according to the findings of Qualcomm’s and Accenture’s report, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6108671984&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harnessing the power of the semiconductor value chain</a>.Having a high-quality patent portfolio also helps companies build out their ecosystem, should they choose to license, through advising, training, support for launches, assistance in expanding to new markets, and much more.</p><p>Licensing democratizes innovation and invention— it makes the cutting-edge IP developed by one firm accessible to a broad range of others. As such, it allows other companies to skip the R&D step and jump right into building on the innovator’s foundation. This lowers the barrier to entry for upstart companies while providing a steady return on investments for the companies who have the resources to dedicate to heavy R&D.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><strong>An outsize economic impact</strong></p><p>IP protection also has an outsized impact on the US economy and helps create good higher-paying jobs. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105345571&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A report from The United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) found that in 2019 industries that intensively use IP protection account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (or about $7.8 trillion) and employ one-third of the total workforce — that’s 47.2 million jobs. In 2019, the average weekly earnings of $1,517 for workers across all IP-intensive industries was 60% higher than weekly earnings for workers in other industries.</p><p>Workers in IP-intensive industries were more likely to earn higher wages as well as participate in employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement plans, the USPTO report found.</p><p> But patent laws are often subject to much debate — one person’s idea of protection is another’s view of monopoly. That’s where organizations like <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105346519&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeadershIP</a> come into play. The group brings together experts on IP and innovation to debate issues at the intersection of research, policy, and industry.</p><p>In addition, several efforts are underway to help inventors get their ideas into the marketplace. The Inventors Patent Academy (TIPA), for instance, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent. TIPA has designed its program to make patenting more accessible and understandable for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQIA, lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Closing these gaps would promote U.S. job creation, entrepreneurial activity, economic growth, and global leadership in innovation. Estimates suggest that increasing participation by underrepresented groups in invention and patenting would quadruple the number of American inventors and increase the annual U.S. gross domestic product <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6106154609&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">by nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>If we want our nation’s rich history of innovation to continue, experts say, we must create an IP protection ecosystem that helps ensure that tech innovation will thrive.</p><p>“With the protection of patents,” Smee said, “there is no limit to where our creativity can take us.”</p>

<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/titus-welliver-as-harry-bosch-in-freevee-s-bosch-legacy-holding-a-flashlight.jpg?id=31860744&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C36%2C0%2C371"/><br/><br/><p>Amazon’s streaming efforts have long been all about Prime Video. So the company caught pundits by surprise when, in early 2019, it launched a stand-alone ad-supported streaming service called IMDb Freedive, with Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/amazons-imdb-launches-a-free-streaming-service-freedive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the move</a> “a bit odd.”</p><p>Nearly four years and two rebrandings later, Amazon’s ad-supported video efforts appear to be flourishing. Viewership of the service <a href="https://videoweek.com/2021/09/23/imdb-tv-is-quietly-becoming-an-avod-juggernaut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew by 138%</a> from 2020 to 2021, according to Amazon. The company declined to share any updated performance data on the service, which is now called Freevee, but a spokesperson told Protocol the performance of originals in particular “exceeded expectations,” leading Amazon to increase investments into original content by 70% year-over-year.</p><p>Key to Freevee’s success has been its deep integration with Prime Video and Fire TV, where it lives alongside ad-free subscription fare, pay-as-you-go rentals, and third-party subscription channels. Now Amazon is looking to broaden its international reach.</p><p>“I'm very excited about the possibility of an ad-supported service in front of the paywall in many countries,” said Ryan Pirozzi, who has been working on Amazon’s video strategy for over a decade and became head of Freevee in August.</p><h3>IMDb TV was not standing out</h3><p>When Amazon first launched its free video service, it was looking to capitalize on the IMDb brand it has owned since 1998. “Our early thinking was, people recognize that brand,” said Pirozzi. However, the branding didn’t exactly catch on with consumers, in part because IMDb was best known as a database for industry professionals. </p><p>Changing the service’s name to IMDb TV did little to solve those issues, which is why the company ultimately switched to the Freevee brand in April of this year. “IMDb TV wasn’t standing out as much as Freevee is,” Pirozzi said. “Personally, I’m very happy we rebranded.”</p><p>Third-party data suggests the rebrand is working: The service’s mobile apps generated about as many downloads since the rebrand as it did during the years preceding it, according to estimates by app intelligence company Sensor Tower. For the five months following the rebrand, downloads were up 113% compared to the preceding five months.</p><p>The total number of installs of the Freevee mobile app is still fairly small, with Sensor Tower estimating the app  has been downloaded 3.3 million times from Google Play and the App Store, while Google’s own data puts the number of downloads from Google Play between 5 and 10 million.</p><p>The service is closely integrated with Prime Video, where its movies and shows are being presented as “free with ads.” Mixing subscription-exclusive content with free, ad-supported videos <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/smart-tvs-content-first" target="_self">can be confusing to consumers</a>, but Pirozzi argued that it was a trade-off for being able to offer more choices, which also includes access to pay-as-you-go movie rentals. </p><p>“We have to work on eliminating any confusion,” he said, adding that Freevee was growing both as a stand-alone service and within Prime Video. “I think people are getting it. Our best SVOD customers are our best TVOD customers [and are also] our most engaged AVOD customers.”<br/></p><h3>Uncertain times for streaming</h3><p>The ascent of Freevee happens as the entire streaming industry is rediscovering free, ad-supported video. Fox has plans to turn its free Tubi streaming service into a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/tubi-will-become-a-billion-dollar-business-foxs-lachlan-murdoch-says" target="_blank">billion-dollar business</a>; Viacom’s Pluto TV reached that same milestone <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>. Even Netflix, which long resisted advertising, is <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-microsoft-ads-partners" target="_self">getting ready to launch an ad-supported tier</a>. </p><p>At the same time, there are some signs that parts of the industry are slowing their investments into originals in light of a more challenging economic climate. Warner Bros. Discovery, for instance, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-strategy?rebelltitem=1" target="_self">canceled several projects for HBO Max recently</a>. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9">

</p><p>“I guess I must have missed the memo,” Pirozzi retorted, pointing to the fact that Freevee’s investments into originals have increased by 70%. Some of the originals running in the service include “Bosch: Legacy,” a spin-off of the police procedural “Bosch” that ran on Prime Video for seven seasons; “Judy Justice,” a remake of “Judge Judy”; and ex-con comedy “Sprung.”</p><p>These shows may not pay for themselves, but they do work to attract new audiences. “Originals and pay-window movies are a customer acquisition driver,” Pirozzi said. “Then we drive depth of engagement with licensed content, deeper catalog, and linear channels. That model has been working for us, and we see big uplifts in our business when we launch something like a ‘Bosch: Legacy.’”</p><p>Many of these originals are also being repurposed for linear free ad-supported streaming channels, also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/plex-live-tv-linear-streaming" target="_self">known as FAST channels among industry insiders</a>. “This rise of FAST linear channels is so fascinating,” Pirozzi said. “To some people, it’s sort of retro. It’s in a linear format without pause or fast forward. But that’s really growing and working for us.”</p><p>Freevee’s more than 100 free linear channels are closely integrated with Amazon’s Fire TV platform, where they are presented as part of the live TV tab. The linear format also allows Amazon to carry some content that it would otherwise not have the rights to, Pirozzi explained. “‘Kim’s Convenience,’ one of my favorite shows on Netflix, is not available to license on demand,” he said. However, Amazon was able to license the show as a linear channel, which it now streams to Freevee viewers.<br/>Freevee debuted in Germany in August after expanding to the U.K. last year. Now, the service is looking to jump into new territories.</p><p>“We have greater international expansion plans,” Pirozzi said. He declined to share Amazon’s exact road map, but suggested that there may be opportunities in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Asia, among others.<br/></p><p>“There are so many places where the value proposition of an ad-supported video product will be very popular with customers,” he said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Biden’s AI Bill of Rights shoots for the stars.

Today we look at the AI Bill of Rights from the White House and how it fits into the existing privacy push by Congress. As you have likely already heard, the Twitter deal is back on. Also, Micron plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in a New York state chip factory thanks to the Chips-Plus package.</em></p><h3>Pie in the sk(AI)</h3><br/><p>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday unveiled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. The document is lofty and well intended, but not particularly practical in the near term — nor to the liking of some AI watchdogs, as Protocol’s Kate Kaye <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights" target="_self">pointed out</a>.</p><ul><li>The white paper sketches out five standards that will help ensure automated systems don’t infringe on our rights: protection from unsafe systems, equitable/nondiscriminatory algorithms, agency over our data, transparency over automated systems, and access to opt-outs and remedies. </li><li>(Sorry, if you were expecting a <a href="https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1577367260510924802?s=20&t=QfFlXeQ5cbsQuosM0y4wog" target="_blank">manifesto on the rights of sentient robots</a>, look elsewhere.) </li></ul><p><strong>The OSTP is careful to emphasize that it’s only intended to support the development of official policies.</strong> In other words, the AI Bill of Rights has as much legal authority as this newsletter. Still, it’s useful in that it represents a sort of regulatory wish list for the Biden administration. </p><ul><li>To be fair, the OSTP includes a lot of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-enterprise/white-house-ai-samsung-chips?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">precise, prescriptive guidance</a> for corporations. The infeasibility doesn’t come from the lack of specific guidance, then, but from the fact that corporations are unlikely to respond unless compelled by the government. </li><li>Some of the guidance is also so disruptive to the status quo that it would remake entire industries. For example, the AI Bill of Rights advises that “you should be able to opt out from automated systems in favor of a human alternative.” But there simply <em>aren’t</em> human alternatives at scale for much of what we do on the internet.</li></ul><p><strong>Sometimes the OSTP doesn’t even seem sure of its own recommendations.</strong> For example, the bill of rights calls for unchecked surveillance to be avoided unless “strictly necessary” but then goes on to say national security agencies should only abide by these guidelines “where feasible.” So, you know … restaurants should never charge extra for guac, but Chipotle can do so “when convenient.” </p><p><strong>These feasibility challenges persist in the prescriptions for the private sector.</strong> </p><ul><li>The OSTP calls for the timely removal of user data from machine learning systems trained with that data. But as I’ve <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/pipelines-data-privacy-design" target="_self">noted before</a>, companies often have no idea where user data flows within their own data pipelines. This complexity likely makes it impossible to comply with existing privacy laws, including the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a>. </li><li>The OSTP also tells companies they should be doing “proactive equity assessments” while also not tracking or using proxies for demographic features. How do you verify lack of bias against a demographic while also ensuring you can’t track it? </li></ul><p><strong>The bill of rights goes above and beyond the primary federal bill under consideration — and that may be its greatest strength. </strong>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text#H88DA5D95E892448B9DDA6F37E0106E77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a> is a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/privacy-draft-2022" target="_self">big deal</a>, even if it suffers from a significant <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/privacy-preemption-adppa?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">preemption problem</a>. But next to the AI Bill of Rights, it looks somewhat unambitious: </p><ul><li>There’s overlap in the sense that both the ADPPA and the AI Bill of Rights say Americans should be able to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/federal-privacy-law-introduced?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">request</a> their information, request that it be deleted, and tell companies to change personal information when it’s not accurate.</li><li>But the bill of rights <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/#privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes</a> many more ambitious privacy goals, including more rigorous consent standards for obtaining user data and better data protections in sensitive user domains such as health care and education. </li><li>The ambiguity and idealism in the AI Bill of Rights can be criticized as its greatest weakness, but in some sense they are its greatest strength: The document shows the federal government is at least thinking of privacy in a much more ambitious way than the bills in Congress would let on. </li></ul><p>The OSTP shot for the stars. Congress is still on the ground building a privacy foundation. That combination in itself can be a great thing. But if ADPPA ends up not passing, what use do we have for a starry-eyed bill of rights? </p><em>— Hirsh Chitkara (</em><a href="mailto:hchitkara@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/hirshchitkara" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em><h3>In Washington</h3><br/><p><strong>The Twitter <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">deal</a></strong><strong> is back on … probably.</strong> Elon Musk on Tuesday sent a letter to Twitter saying he’d buy the company at his original offered price of $54.20 per share.

One area that’s being built out is crypto trading as a service, with APIs and other products that developers and companies can use to set up crypto trading for their clients. </p><p>The latest sign of this maturation is EDX Markets, a new exchange for digital assets that’s being developed by Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab, as well as venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm.</p><p>The digital exchange, headed by former Citadel Securities executive Jamil Nazarali, is roughly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-and-others-start-crypto-exchange-edx-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeled</a> on and built on the trading technology of Members Exchange, or MEMX, another exchange that’s being developed by similar companies as an alternative to large stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq.</p><p>EDXM’s custody and wallet technology is being provided by crypto custody and infrastructure company Paxos, the companies announced Wednesday</p><p>Paxos, which is a custodian regulated by New York state, holds customer accounts in fully segregated accounts and has signed up large consumer-facing clients to enable crypto trading. Its customers include PayPal, broker dealers such as Interactive Brokers, and others such as Nubank and Mastercard. Paxos has a conditional bank trust charter from the <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCC</a> and says it expects its chartered entity, Paxos National Trust, to open later this quarter.</p><p>Up until now big banks haven’t moved heavily into crypto because of accounting, risk, security, and regulatory concerns, as well as requirements by the Federal Reserve and a desire for more mature technology, said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “We still haven't seen any of the big bank holding companies in the U.S. bring one of these offerings to market,” he added.</p><p>EDXM, with its leadership and backing from Wall Street firms, could attract large banks into digital assets, he said. EDXM is “bringing traditional market structure and also traditional market participants to this liquidity offering through the exchange that is going to be really built to support and attract these types of bank holding companies and brokerages,” Hessert said. For example, EDXM plans to offer delivery settlement versus payment <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/172104/edx-markets-ceo-vows-to-learn-from-travails-at-rival-institutional-crypto-exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settlement</a>, a settlement method that’s used in traditional securities trading. </p><p>EDXM is also different from some other crypto providers that are the market maker, exchange, and custodian all in one, which can be a conflict of interest and is typically not done in traditional markets, Hessert said.</p><p>More large liquidity pools such as EDXM will also increase transparency for the crypto market, Hessert said. Presently, crypto markets can be opaque, with large spreads and high volatility.</p><p>The competition to provide crypto trading, custody, security, and related technology for large institutions is intense. The resulting consolidation wave isn’t without some hiccups: Wyre canceled its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/bolt-axes-15b-deal-to-buy-crypto-infrastructure-provider-wyre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal</a> to be acquired by Bolt for $1.5 billion last month. But more deals could soon come in this sector, since numerous providers offer overlapping services, analysts say. </p><p>Coinbase provides crypto trading APIs, custody, payments API, and related services, seeking to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/coinbase-cloud-node" target="_self">lure big and small</a> customers alike. Coinbase has three related APIs — a general-purpose one for trading, deposits, withdrawals, and tax reporting; another for streaming market data; and a specialized FIX API for sophisticated traders. Coinbase, which recently announced a deal with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/blackrock-to-offer-crypto-for-institutional-investors-through-coinbase-prime/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, has an advantage in routing orders to its own exchange or, for large customers using its Prime API, to other liquidity providers. </p><p>A number of other API providers like Prime Trust, MoonPay, Wyre, and Transak have emerged to offer quick and easy connections to crypto trading and other services, particularly for fintech and crypto developers building apps. Custody providers such as Anchorage and Fireblocks also offer crypto trading.

Too bad. https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/apple-app-store-price-hike Wed, 05 Oct 2022 11:15:09 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/apple-s-planned-price-hike-is-going-into-effect.png?id=31864079&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><strong>Good morning! </strong>Apple hiked App Store prices by around 20% in some markets outside the U.S. without any explanation and with barely any notice. Critics are unsurprisingly upset, but what choice do they have?</p><h3>It’s Apple’s party, and it’ll charge if it wants to</h3><br/><p>The App Store just became a little pricier for many non-U.S. customers. Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e1b1hcmv&1663640181" target="_blank">planned price hike</a> went into effect today for any market that uses the euro, in addition to Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In most markets, the price increase equates to about 20% higher costs for apps (though it’s even more in some countries, like Japan and South Korea). So a mobile app that was previously 0.99 euros now costs 1.19 euros, while the same is true for an in-app purchase like mobile game currency. Curiously, Apple isn’t saying why exactly, leaving developers to guess whether it’s due to currency fluctuations, the related global economic crisis, or perhaps rising energy costs related to operating the App Store overseas. </p>
<p><strong>The price hike is arriving at a sensitive time. </strong>The combination of record inflation and a looming global recession has started to take a serious toll on foreign markets as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/16/business/strong-dollar.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strength of the U.S. dollar continues to grow</a> relative to weakening foreign currencies like the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. </p><ul><li>While Apple has yet to raise prices in the U.S., it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/apple-raises-iphone-14-price-in-uk-japan-australia-overseas-markets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiked the price</a> of the new iPhone 14 lineup in Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K., in some cases by the equivalent of nearly $150. </li><li>A number of other consumer electronics companies, including PlayStation maker Sony, have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enacted similar hardware price hikes</a> in the EU and other markets in recent months. </li><li>Apple can certainly afford to weather any economic storms better than most, if not all, of its competitors. In its last earnings announcement from July, Apple said it had a record Q3 with $19.6 billion in services revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. </li><li>The company remains the most valuable in the world with a market cap of more than $2.3 trillion. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple critics are not pleased. </strong>Naturally, a price hike with little explanation and on such short notice is going to rankle Apple's usual detractors in the developer community, including Fortnite maker Epic Games. But the criticisms have grown especially pointed given the current economic climate. </p><ul><li>“These increases were made without the input or consent of app developers, which highlights the extent of Apple’s market power. In no other industry can a business single-handedly increase the prices of another business’s products,” <a href="https://appfairness.org/coalition-for-app-fairness-blog-on-apple-price-increases/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Rick VanMeter, the executive director for the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness, of which Epic, Match Group, and Spotify are members. </li><li>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had harsh words, too. “Imagine if a landlord told their small business tenant they had to increase their prices without any say in the matter or anywhere else to go,” he said in a statement yesterday. “That is what Apple is doing to developers for no other reason than to pad Apple’s bottom line.”</li><li>“Developers don't want to raise their app prices in the EU and UK. Consumers don't want app price increases in the EU and UK. Central banks fighting inflation don't want app price inflation,” Sweeney wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1577032444955746304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">follow-up tweet yesterday</a>. “But Apple is raising developers' prices against developers' wishes.” </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple is no stranger to sudden price increases. </strong>For decades, the iPhone maker has exercised near-total control of its software ecosystems, including the digital storefronts it has operated since the days of iTunes. </p>
<ul><li>You might remember when Apple infamously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/apple-begins-variable-pricing-on-itunes-store-some-songs-now-129-each/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the price</a> of newer, more popular MP3s on the iTunes Store from 99 cents to $1.29. The move, a concession to the music industry, helped <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/09/itunes_price_increases_mean_slower_sales_for_music_labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labels sell more albums</a> after years of complaints that the era of iTunes pushed consumers toward buying singles over albums. There was plenty of hand-wringing at the time, but nothing really changed. That is, until music streaming took off and individual song sales began to decline. </li></ul>
<p>But there is no comparable distribution change for mobile apps or the App Store on the horizon. Apple sets the rules for commerce on iOS, and everyone must follow — so long as they want to reach iPhone customers.<br/><br/><em>— Nick Statt</em><br/></p><h3>The Twitter drama has only just begun</h3><br><p>Elon Musk decided, seemingly out of nowhere, that he actually <em>will</em> buy Twitter. But before you assume the roller coaster ride is over, think again.</p>
<p><strong>Musk <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">sent a letter</a> to Twitter </strong>proposing to buy the company at the original, agreed-upon price of $54.20 a share provided the company agrees to forget the whole court battle. Twitter shares jumped on the news before exchanges halted trading.</p>
<ul><li>The news coincidentally broke at the same time Twitter employees were entering a long meeting about its 2023 strategy. Very funny, we know.</li><li>Twitter said it received Musk’s letter and intends to close the deal at the original price. It hasn’t addressed Musk’s proposal to end its lawsuit.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk and Twitter could be entering even muddier waters, </strong>where the company will transition to a whole new owner who has expressed rather controversial ideas about the service. What happens next could go like this, as described by Protocol Policy editor Kate Cox:</p><ul><li>Step one: Musk buys Twitter!</li><li>Step two: ???</li><li>Step three: Twitter reaches profitability under Musk.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk loves to prove the skeptics wrong, </strong>and turning Twitter around could be another way to do it. But those question marks are there for a reason: the details of how he would do it are beyond murky. </p><ul><li>How will Twitter employees — the ones who haven’t fled the company in droves as the acquisition moil unfolded, that is — react? </li><li>How will he handle the spam problem he cited as an excuse to walk away from the deal?</li><li>Musk offered one cryptic hint about his plans in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>: “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-elon-musk-buys-his-old-x-com-domain-from-paypal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reclaimed</a> the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, and has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1557199404301307904" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teased</a> the idea of building a Twitter competitor on it.</li></ul>There are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/twitter-lbo-revives-12-5-billion-headache-for-wall-street-banks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questions about the debt financing</a> needed to close the deal, and Musk and Twitter will have to thrash out what to do about the pending lawsuit. But if they can overcome those obstacles, Twitter will get a new owner and a different future. The one true thing we can say about both: They are completely unpredictable.<br/><br/><p><em>— Sarah Roach</em></p><h3>​The calm before the storm</h3><br><p>Hundreds of companies that cut staff in recent months announced major funding rounds just a few months before. But startups aren’t blowing through their funding weeks after the check is deposited; it’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/layoffs-funding-data" target="_self">more complicated than that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Startups often wait several months to a year </strong>after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public about it.</p><ul><li>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners, told Nat. </li><li>This is because founders often want to announce funding with other big news, like a product release or an executive hire. </li></ul>
<p><strong>The bigger an organization gets, </strong>the more secretive it becomes about funding updates. News of a big check is easier to keep from leaking publicly at a company of 100 compared to a company of 2,000, Alban said. </p><ul><li>Companies like Bolt, Getir, and Trade Republic caught flack for this very reason. Many employees said they felt betrayed, as funding announcements gave the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. </li><li>“Bolt employees were blind sided because the CEO was saying just weeks ago how everything is fine,” <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Bolt-just-layed-off-people-in-the-worst-way-possible-yL7QauTE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an anonymous user wrote on the message board Blind</a>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>To help ease the blow of layoffs, </strong>being transparent can go a long way. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Anthony Kline, a partner at VC firm The GP.<br/><br/><em>— Nat Rubio-Licht</em><br/></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM CAPITAL ONE SOFTWARE</h3><br><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="0b87547b908f01341fe8a968efb24080" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123932305&iu=/21901267728" id="b689f" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843120&width=980"/></a>Many business leaders aren’t sure where to begin when it comes to migrating to the cloud.

The legislation allowed some families to <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/taxact/file-for-less-and-get-more/understanding-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly double</a> their tax benefits per child, which was especially critical for low-income families, who disproportionately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/04/20/covid-19-pandemic-pinches-finances-of-americas-lower-and-middle-income-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bore the financial brunt</a> of the pandemic. </p><p>For Amanda Renteria, the <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/safety-net-innovation-lab-audacious-ted-talk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEO of Code for America</a>, the new legislation meant the work had only just begun. Renteria understood that making tax credits available is one thing, but helping families navigate bureaucracy to get them is another. Renteria also knew that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a nonprofit that helps the government use technology to better serve communities, could play a critical role in addressing that access problem. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Renteria explained how she made the decision to develop a proof of concept for an app that would help people claim the Child Tax Credit. Code for America developed this mock-up despite limited resources and no guarantee that it would be selected by the government as its technology partner. The leap of faith ended up paying off, and Code for America reported in May that it <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/code-for-america-getctc-portal-returns-for-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped</a> 115,000 families successfully claim the tax benefit throughout the 2021 tax filing season. </p><p><em>Renteria’s story, as told to Protocol, has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What we knew about the IRS, having worked with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program [last year], is just how hard it is for people to get through [the system to get benefits].</strong> With VITA, we helped create an online, mobile-friendly, simplified application that actually walks you through [the process] in both English and Spanish. </p><p><strong>When Child Tax Credit came up, we knew that this policy — though it passed and everyone was excited about it — would actually hit a wall. </strong>We had seen the barriers over time on much easier processes, like food assistance in some states. </p><p><strong>We knew filling out forms is extremely difficult.</strong> So there wasn't even a question of whether or not we could make this process better. Again, [this was] largely because we had been doing it for a while. We helped VITA sites go online the year before, and we could actually see how you improve throughput if you have a simplified process.</p><p><strong>The big question for us was whether we wanted to build it, knowing we weren't sure whether it would land. </strong>A lot of the question was how we bring the White House, the Treasury, and the IRS up to speed with our lessons learned. We are a small nonprofit. There were no guarantees that anyone would believe us — trust not only our data, but our ability to do it. </p><p><strong>We felt our need to jump in because we didn’t see it happening anywhere else. </strong>During that period of time, we were still in transition to a new administration, so we knew that the federal government was still building up its digital talent. The private sector was also focused on higher-end clients and how they were going to live in a new online world. Everything was changing during a pandemic, and the only way we were going to reach [families] was through their phones, and trying to be as simplified and trustworthy as possible.</p><p><strong>So in very short order, our engineering team put together a mock-up of what it would look like.</strong> [It showed] what the experience would be, how we would triage, how we would ensure that clients are being taken care of through chat. We were able to turn this around in a couple of weeks, but it was based on 10 years of research. We were really confident in our ability to create a front door that spoke to the clients we were trying to serve. We were less confident in whether or not it would be enough to show [the White House] what's possible.</p><p><strong>In a meeting with the White House and Treasury, we walked through the actual process someone would go through.</strong> Within that, not only did we build trust in terms of the relationship we already had, but the tangibility of seeing the vision of what was possible was a key difference for them. But that took some risk on our part — we had to build it before we knew whether it would actually be a relationship that could lead to the scale we have now proved to have.</p><p><div id="series-box"></div>

With the change, Parikh is now the sole chief executive of the privately held company, a prominent up-and-coming player in cloud security that last year achieved a valuation of $8.3 billion.</p><p>Lacework planned to inform employees of the change on Tuesday. Hatfield, who previously served as president at Pure Storage, leaves Lacework's executive leadership a few months shy of his second year with the company. </p><p>As part of the co-CEO model, Hatfield, who goes by the nickname "Hat," focused on business operations and expansion at Lacework, which has raised $1.85 billion in funding. Hatfield joined Lacework as CEO and chairman in early 2021. He could not immediately be reached Tuesday.</p><p>Parikh joined as co-CEO in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-lacework-jay-parikh" target="_blank">mid-2021</a>, and has focused on product and engineering for the company. The two have known each other for two decades, having previously worked at the same time at Akamai Technologies.</p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Parikh characterized the move as planned and amicable, prompted by conversations between "Hat, myself, and the board" that led to the conclusion that the co-CEO model was no longer the best fit for the company. Lacework's executive leadership and board have been "looking at where the business is and what it needs to get to the next level," and have determined that "unifying the company" under a single CEO made the most sense right now, Parikh said.</p><p>When it comes to Lacework's product and sales strategy and its relationships with customers, partners, and the big public cloud platforms, the move should help with "making sure that's all unified [around] one set of priorities with one focus," he said.</p><p>Parikh said he doesn't believe Hatfield has "any immediate plan to go jump into anything full-time anytime soon." Hatfield is "still going to be spending a good amount of time" on Lacework, Parikh told Protocol.<br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-right" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: right;">

</p><p>Founded in 2014, Lacework offers a "data-driven" service that aims to stand out in the fast-growing cloud security market by collecting and analyzing data from across a customer's cloud environments. The goal is to to provide customers with crucial security insights, such as which threats to prioritize for action, the company has said.</p><p>The company raised a $525 million funding round in January 2021, followed by an additional $1.3 billion in funding in November 2021 that brought with it the $8.3 billion valuation. Lacework touted that round as "the largest funding round in security industry history," and the company ranks at No. 3 in terms of the biggest valuations for privately held security companies, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank">CB Insights</a>.</p><p>Lacework is also notable for having been just the third company to be incubated out of Sutter Hill Ventures, following a model that was used to launch Pure Storage and Snowflake. The Lacework platform supports AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as Kubernetes environments. </p><p>In May, Lacework disclosed that it had laid off <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/lacework-layoffs-cloud-security-startup" target="_blank">20% of its staff</a>, in response to what the co-CEOs <a href="https://www.lacework.com/blog/lacework-update/" target="_blank">then described</a> as a "seismic shift" in "both the public and private markets." The company had previously <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/cybersecurity-has-53-unicorns-here-are-10-to-watch/" target="_blank">reported</a> having more than 1,000 employees as of March, and did not immediately have a figure available for its current employee count on Tuesday.</p><p>Prior to Lacework, Hatfield had previously spent nearly seven years as president at Pure Storage followed by 16 months as its vice chair, according to his LinkedIn. He joined the company as president in 2013, a few years into its founding, and stayed on through its initial public offering and its first several years as a public company.</p><p>While there are no plans to directly replace Hatfield at Lacework, given the unification of the CEO duties under Parikh's leadership, the company does plan to hire a chief revenue officer in the near future, Parikh said.</p><p>Ultimately, Lacework's leadership is focusing on making moves that will set it up "to be successful over 10, 20 years — we're not building this to be a transaction," Parikh said. <br/></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The future of pay transparency in tech https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/pay-transparency-in-tech-sb1162 Tue, 04 Oct 2022 22:07:11 +0000

We spoke with Susan Alban, operating partner and chief people officer at Renegade Partners, and compensation consultant Ashish Raina to learn how.</p><hr/><p><strong>Startups will adopt pay bands earlier.</strong> Five or 10 years ago, it wasn’t unusual for 50-person companies to be operating without a “career ladder” or “career architecture” with compensation bands for different job functions and levels, Alban said.</p><ul><li>Today’s tighter labor market — and demands from candidates — mean that companies structure their compensation bands sooner.</li><li>Because the new law applies to companies with just 15 employees, even tiny startups will be required to define their pay bands in a more structured way, Alban said.</li><li>“Which is a little funky when you have, like, eight people, to have a band for every single job, because sometimes you just have one person in a job,” she said. “It just nudges companies to be a little bit more thoughtful in defining what is the job, what is the relative seniority, and what would we reasonably pay relative to market-based pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>Companies may find other ways to differentiate pay in order to compete for the best talent. </strong>The law only requires companies to disclose base pay, not stock, bonuses, or benefits. </p><ul><li>This means bonuses and equity could become more important forms of compensation, which may shift the issue of unequal pay to other areas.</li><li>Bonuses “can be very arbitrary,” especially in early-stage companies where goals change all the time, Alban said.</li><li>They may prove to be even more important levers for attracting and retaining great employees, however. “Fair pay is not equal pay,” Raina said. “If someone is more proficient or more highly performing in a role, there should be a differentiation in pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>The law might provide a little more incentive for companies to hire outside of California, </strong>but not much. The law on its own is unlikely to have a major effect on where companies hire, but it adds more administrative headache to California employers.</p><ul><li>“I don’t hear employers talking about not wanting to hire in the state of Colorado because of these laws,” Alban said.</li><li>Some companies may choose to advertise jobs with a national labor rate that would overpay candidates in low-cost states like Mississippi but underpay Californians, Raina said.</li></ul><p><strong>Big companies are likely to comply more readily than startups.</strong> An online job search shows companies like Google, Salesforce, and Twitter listing pay ranges in ads. Some listings cite the Colorado law explicitly.</p><ul><li>“I think the general consensus among progressive technology employers is that this is the way the world is going,” Alban said. “Rather than fret about it and deviate from hiring in particular regions to avoid compliance, better to just comply anyway.”</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li>Some startups likely won’t comply with the law, Raina said. “They’re trying to survive,” he said. “Yes, this law exists, and yes, there’s going to be some risk if they don’t comply, but that isn’t necessarily people’s forefront of an issue.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The EU ushers in the USB-C era https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-apple-iphone-ewaste Tue, 04 Oct 2022 19:32:24 +0000

The mandate will extend to laptops in 2026. </p><p>The rule — which was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-charging-ewaste" target="_blank">introduced in June</a> — passed 602-13, while eight members abstaining from voting. That reflects an overwhelming desire to make the average person's life easier (goodbye, cluttered junk drawer) as well as cut down on pernicious e-waste. While the decision means that ports such as micro-USB will fall by the wayside, Apple's Lightning port is also slated to go the way of the dinosaur. </p><p>The company's iPad and various MacBooks rely on USB-C charging. But Apple has held steadfastly to the technology for the iPhone, rolling out its most recent iteration of the phone with a Lightning rather than a USB-C port. The iPhone was the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/31/european-smartphone-market-2021/" target="_blank">bestselling phone</a> in the EU last year, with Apple capturing 34% of the smartphone market.</p><p>The European Council needs to sign off on the legislation before it officially goes into law. But that prospect looks likely. After that, the clock to USB-C hegemony begins counting down. The timing could work out well for Apple at least; the company releases a new iPhone every year in September. With the mandate likely to take effect in fall 2024, it means next year's iPhone could well be the last one to feature a Lightning port — unless Apple decides to just get the switch over with, something the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066661/apple-iphone-15-drop-lightning-port-usb-c-2023-prediction-rumor" target="_blank">company is reportedly considering</a>. </p><p>The company could also make a USB-C version of the iPhone for the EU and a Lightning version for everyone else, of course, but that seems unlikely given the logistical hurdles. The iPhone could also go totally portless for charging, though that would be a much more radical leap. <br/></p><p>As written, the rule would allow electronics without a USB-C port to continue being sold as long as they are "placed on the market before the date of application," according to a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the vote. Regardless, if you're a Lightning stan, uh, you should consider snapping up an iPhone 14 sooner than later.</p><p>Cutting down on e-waste is a sneaky climate policy. The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Pages/Spotlight/Global-Ewaste-Monitor-2020.aspx" target="_blank">Global E-Waste Monitor</a> put out by the United Nations showed that nearly 54 million tons of e-waste piled up in 2020, a number that could rise to almost 75 million tons by the end of this decade. That's a local environmental concern given the toxic chemicals and components. But it's also a huge waste of emissions. More than two-thirds of the carbon pollution tied to electronics is emitted in the manufacturing process. </p><p>Cutting down on the number of charging cables produced (and trashed) is a relatively modest way to cut down on e-waste. Stronger policies that favor right-to-repair as well as companies working harder to stave off forced obsolescence could also offer a pathway to reduce the amount of electronic churn. Improving e-waste recycling is yet another avenue to cut down on trash; the Global E-Waste Monitor found only 17.4% of electronic trash is currently recycled. Apple and other tech companies have touted moving toward a circular economy as central to their sustainability goals. While the EU's USB-C mandate alone won't make that transition magically happen, it could spur further innovation and serve as a reminder of all the work that remains to be done.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Why $100 per ton is the carbon removal industry's holy grail https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-removal-cost-per-ton Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:03:51 +0000

It’s one of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/frontier-cdr-purchases-stripe-alphabet" target="_self">Frontier’s</a> stated criteria that the fund uses to evaluate its advance purchases. In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of the long-duration carbon removal community, CarbonPlan found that stakeholders are focused on the $100 benchmark. The Department of Energy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/climate/glasgow-carbon-removal-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even announced</a> that it would be investing in carbon removal research to bring the cost of the technology down to $100 per ton.</p><hr/><p><strong>Where did that number come from? </strong>In short, it’s the cost per ton of removal services that it would take for the CDR industry to reach commercial viability. It’s based on a handful of factors. </p><ul><li>It’s the point at which carbon removal becomes affordable at the scale needed to make it a meaningful tool to reach net zero (and, eventually, negative emissions), Shuchi Talati, a senior visiting scholar at Carbon180, told Protocol. </li><li>It evolved from modeling and policy conversations, and is aligned with other existing costs, like the European Union’s carbon price (which will likely reach that number in a decade). </li><li>It’s also tied to the social cost of carbon, a metric that measures the economic damage a ton of carbon emitted causes. Estimates of the social cost of carbon keep increasing as climate damages become clearer.</li><li>Another reason could be much simpler. The climate community could just be taking its cue from the DOE, anchoring its own targets to the agency’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Carbon Negative Shot target</a>, which was set for $100 per ton, CarbonPlan’s Danny Cullenward wrote in an email to Protocol.</li></ul><p><strong>So far, no one has come anywhere close to reaching that target. </strong>Currently, most carbon removal services cost well above $100 per ton, although the Inflation Reduction Act’s updated 45Q tax credit of up to $180 per ton for direct air capture could help some startups get closer to achieving that target. </p><p>“$100 per ton is an extremely ambitious 10-year target, likely probably more of a 15- to 20-year target,” Talati said. But she thinks it’s “important to be ambitious,” and “there’s a lot of momentum around CDR and getting these technologies to scale.”</p><p>The world could have to remove <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-needs" target="_self">billions of tons of carbon pollution</a> per year from the atmosphere by midcentury depending on how fast emissions fall in the interim.

Within hours, it had become clear that Stadia’s shutdown, planned for next January, would involve more than just refunding consumer purchases and quietly bowing out.</p><p>Now developers are scrambling to salvage planned projects, migrate players to other platforms, and figure out whether they’re still owed money from Google before the search giant puts Stadia out to pasture for good.</p><hr/><p><strong>Stadia’s shutdown came as a surprise.</strong> Scores of indie game makers, not typically bound by the conservative norms of corporate PR, took to Twitter to explain their frustrations upon learning of the shutdown from news articles and a terse <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five-paragraph blog post</a> from Stadia chief Phil Harrison. </p><ul><li>“Tangle Tower was due to launch on Stadia in 2 days time, and this article was the first I heard about it shutting down,” SFB Games co-founder Tom Vian <a href="https://twitter.com/SFBTom/status/1575558078367690752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Thursday.</li><li>“We have a title coming out November 1st,” Rebecca Heineman, CEO of indie studio Olde Sküül, wrote in response to Vian. “Now we hear about this.” Olde Sküül has since <a href="https://twitter.com/OldeSkuul/status/1575863134857793536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it will release its planned Stadia game, Luxor Evolved, on console and PC in 2023. </li><li>“We have a game coming to Stadia in November.

The consensus: We’re looking into it. </p><ul><li>Ubisoft has been Google’s longest cloud gaming partner, having given the company Assassin’s Creed Origins to test Stadia’s Project Stream predecessor. And with 38 games on the platform, Ubisoft <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> it was “working” to allow Stadia customers to bring those purchases to PC but had nothing more to share. </li><li>“We hear you - we are looking into ways for you to continue your HITMAN experience on other platforms,” <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Hitman developer IO Interactive. </li><li>“All I can say now is that we’re currently looking into the matter, and exploring possible options,” a representative of Cyberpunk 2077 studio CD Projekt Red <a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1576970793006747648" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Verge</a>. </li><li>“We just learned about Stadia shutting down and have begun conversations about next steps for our players,” a Bungie representative <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5Efe3ce7c2836c90e2787ce169a12fbfa6c976cdbd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fdestiny-2-and-hitman-developers-respond-to-google-stadia-shutdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> to the company’s Destiny 2 forums. </li><li>One player of the online component of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 who logged more than 6,000 hours into the game for Twitch and YouTube content has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-onlines-biggest-superfan-may-lose-6000-hours-of-progress-on-stadia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no idea if they can migrate their account</a> off of Stadia. Rockstar has yet to respond to Stadia’s shutdown. </li></ul><p><strong>It’s not clear why Google axed Stadia now,</strong> and why it did so with little to no warning for any of the various parties that invested time, money, and other resources into the platform over the last three years. </p><ul><li>Google is undergoing a serious cost-cutting effort at the moment to contend with the economic downturn. And Stadia was expensive: Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that Stadia spent tens of millions of dollars just to secure rights to a single big-budget release like Red Dead Redemption 2. </li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/google-ceo-says-he-hopes-to-make-company-20percent-more-efficient-hints-at-potential-cuts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last month he wants to make the company “20% more productive,” and hiring slowdowns, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348999/google-pixelbook-canceled-team-shut-down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancellation of a new Pixelbook</a>, and other cost-cutting efforts may have pushed Stadia toward the chopping block.</li><li>Stadia arrived on the gaming scene with big ambitions in 2019 that included developing original exclusives that would make use of the platform’s cloud computing advantages. </li><li>But Google’s internal studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-shuts-down-internal-studios-changing-bus-1846146761" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered</a> less than 18 months after launch, and many of its ambitious cloud features like State Share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-had-big-disruptive-ideas-that-others-should-steal/1100-6507965/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never made it to more than 10% of the platform</a>.</li><li>Ultimately, Stadia chief Harrison said the main culprit was a lack of growth: “While Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected.” </li><li>"The number one problem is the business model. Secondly, you need to deliver something consumers cannot get elsewhere," said Benjy Boxer, the co-founder of game streaming platform Parsec who now oversees the product at Unity. "In my opinion, the only way cloud gaming will ever shift to the mainstream is if we get to a point where we’re not selling the distribution technology and instead selling a unique value proposition." </li><li>Boxer said Stadia had "amazing technology" but failed at selling coherent product and experience. "Stadia never figured out who their customer was," he added.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s perhaps too early to draw broader conclusions about Stadia’s closure,</strong> what it could mean for cloud gaming as a whole, and whether the platform’s demise is the nail in the coffin for Google’s gaming ambitions. But Google’s sloppy handling of the announcement and Stadia’s stunning failure is evidence that even the largest, most experienced companies can find themselves lost in the woods when trying to crack such a notoriously difficult set of problems. </p><p>Cloud gaming is still available on platforms operated by Microsoft, Nvidia, and — for the time being — Amazon, too. But developing games is costly, difficult, and multidisciplinary work that takes years, and streaming those games over the cloud has yet to be accomplished in a sustainable fashion with an attractive business model. Google found this out the hard way, and let’s hope Stadia’s shutdown provides the road map that helps keep its competitors alive.</p><p><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Entertainment newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={This carbon capture startup wants to decarbonize the world’s biggest polluters https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-clean-point-source-capture Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:47:57 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/ceo-and-co-founder-of-carbon-clean-aniruddha-sharma.jpg?id=31859764&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C256%2C0%2C412"/><br/><br/><p>Carbon capture and storage has taken on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-capture-venture-capital-investment" target="_self">increasing importance</a> as companies with stubborn emissions look for new ways to meet their net zero goals. For hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel production, it’s one of the few options that exist to help them get there. </p><p>Yet it’s proven incredibly challenging to scale the technology, which captures carbon pollution at the source. U.K.-based company Carbon Clean is leading the charge to bring down costs. This year, it raised a $150 million series C round, which the startup said is the largest-ever funding round for a point-source carbon capture company. </p><p>Carbon capture and storage is controversial in part due to the industries it serves; while cement and steel makers are among the industries that all but require CCS to lower emissions, oil and gas companies have also shown great interest. Carbon Clean’s latest funding round was led by Chevron, and the technology is seen as a potential lifeline for the fossil fuel industry, despite there being readily available alternatives like renewables and electric vehicles. </p><p>The technology has also been criticized for not delivering the emissions reductions it promises. That includes an infamous case last year involving none other than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/a-shocking-failure-chevron-criticised-for-missing-carbon-capture-target-at-wa-gas-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevron in Western Australia</a>, in which the company missed its targets, and a Shell blue hydrogen project that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shell-ccs-carbon-capture-1848401554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emitted more carbon than it captured</a>. The <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> has also lambasted the Department of Energy for investing $1.1 billion in projects that largely failed to live up to expectations.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop that Carbon Clean is striving to clean up CCS’ image and deliver on its promise. Carbon Clean CEO Aniruddha Sharma told Protocol that fossil fuels are necessary, at least in the near term, to lift the living standards of those who don’t have access to cars and electricity.</p><p>While technologies like CCS hold a lot of promise, helping the world potentially address that issue while still meeting net zero goals, the risks of locking in more fossil fuel use are real, especially if Carbon Clean and other CCS companies can’t scale as promised. CCS also does nothing to help with other forms of local air pollution, which is a major public health concern. </p><p>Sharma, for his part, said he has “done nothing else but carbon capture” his professional life. Along with co-founder and CTO Prateek Bumb, he started working on Carbon Clean’s technology out of university. Bumb had done a five-month internship in Italy studying decarbonization science, and Sharma asked him who was doing that work in India. “No one,” he told him, and thus Carbon Clean was born.</p><p>He spoke to Protocol about what Carbon Clean has learned, the future of point-source CCS, as well as the role of companies like his in battling the climate crisis.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What’s the most challenging part of carbon capture that you’re still working through?</strong></p><p>Scale up is the most challenging part. The technology is working right now. Going from here to the next level of scale up, maybe 10 times bigger, is going to be interesting and challenging, both because you’re trying to increase the equipment size and you’re trying to increase our supply chain. Once you’ve got the materials, then you need a workshop or machining capacity capability that can actually produce the equipment specifically for you. But in the current atmosphere, that’s not something that’s necessarily available. So we’re spending a lot of time on how we scale up both the supply chain and the equipment and the delivery capability.</p><p><strong>You just raised a $150 million series C led by Chevron. A bulk of your investment comes from fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco and Equinor. How do you make sure your work isn’t just a way for them to pay to continue polluting?</strong></p><p>President Biden is asking oil and gas companies to produce more oil, but they’re not necessarily producing that much oil because the market doesn’t necessarily see producing fossil fuels as a good thing to do. So I think people realize that there is a need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and work towards the energy transition. </p><p>From our perspective, whenever you partner with companies like Chevron, we always look for proof in the pudding. Chevron has committed $10 billion to Chevron New Energies, which is solely working on decarbonization. If they have the biggest footprint today, they’re the ones that need the most help decarbonizing. </p><p><strong>How do you make sure the removal project doesn’t negatively impact the local communities adjacent to the carbon capture?</strong></p><p>I think the issue is much deeper: How does the energy transition in general impact the population and the people being affected by it? When these companies start reducing their production, there will be more jobs available and you can reorient a lot of them towards decarbonization. We’re also leading the creation of a new industry that actually didn’t exist. If you think about decarbonization and the level where we need to be — or should be — over the next 10 years, you’re talking about creating five companies the size of Exxon or Chevron in the decarbonization space. These companies will employ tens of thousands of people, so we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of job opportunities to be created for decarbonization. For our company, we ensure that the impact of what we’re trying to do is translated into the local communities.</p><p><strong>How much should your corporate clients be relying on your services when it comes to reaching their net zero or decarbonization goals? In other words, what proportion of their drawdown should come from emissions reductions versus paying for point-source carbon capture?</strong> </p><p>I generally advise our customers to diversify their options. I tell my customers that in 2024, get one unit at your site and spend 10% of your money for decarbonization using one of our carbon capture boxes, spend 10% for another form of decarbonization, and another 10% for electrification, and maybe another 10% for biomass. Try all the options across the board, so that within a year or two, you know which one or two options to scale up. Maybe carbon capture and electrification are the best options for you. If you’re in California, green hydrogen carbon capture is the perfect option for you, so we’re not saying that ours is the only solution. </p><p><strong>But how much of their decarbonization journey should come from any sort of carbon capture versus just not having that pollution be released at all?</strong></p><p>I think that’s where the conundrum is, right? We help decarbonize heavy industries like steel and cement, which are relatively difficult to replace in the medium term. </p><p><strong>But you also work with fossil fuel companies, for which there are renewable alternatives.</strong> </p><p>We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity? We have to keep using heavy industrial products for some time more. And we cannot allow them to just run like that; we have to decarbonize them today. </p><p class="pull-quote">"We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity?"</p><p><strong>So is it your hope that eventually your company won’t have to exist?<br/><br/></strong>I think heavy industry will always exist. So we’ll always be there supporting the decarbonization. If you think about brute numbers, 2 billion people today don’t have access to electricity. <em>[Editor’s note: The International Energy Agency pegs that number at </em><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity" target="_blank"><em>770 million</em></a><em>.] </em>How much of an industrial output needs to be produced to elevate and alleviate poverty for 2 billion people? It’d be immoral to say, “Well, actually, you know what, steel and cement companies, stop tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Bigger picture: How much CCS does the world need? Put a number on what you expect. A gigaton? Less? More?</strong></p><p>Let’s work backwards. Industrial emitters today contribute about 25% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, more or less. That’s about 10 billion tons of emissions. Even if you said that we will be able to electrify some of it or use hydrogen for some part of it, you would still need to decarbonize a significant chunk of that 10 billion tons using point-source carbon capture technologies, and they need to happen between now and 2040. As a company, we are focused on scaling our solution and the availability of that solution to a billion tons per year of carbon dioxide captured. </p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Musk may buy Twitter after all https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:41:39 +0000

While most firms fell into the range of cutting staff two to three months after making funding announcements, a handful of companies waited two weeks or less after going public about funding rounds before making layoffs. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" frameborder="0" height="450" id="datawrapper-chart-gI4RQ" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gI4RQ/5/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Layoffs after announcing new funding"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r</script></div><p><br/></p><p>Are firms blowing through millions in the weeks after the check is deposited in the bank? Experts told Protocol that it's more complicated than that. Startups wait several months to a year after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public with the news, but the delay can result in terrible optics and often a feeling of betrayal among those laid off. </p><h3> Keeping it quiet</h3><p>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” said Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners. A founder may not want their competitors to know about funding, or want to wait until there are other announcements to tack onto a funding round, like a product release or a new executive hire, to do a press push. </p><p>Funding details become more exclusive the bigger an organization gets. At a company with 100 employees, it's easier to keep the news of a major hire or a big VC check from slipping. But at a company with 2,000 people, “announcing it internally is announcing it publicly,” said Alban. “Even if you know everyone is under an NDA, you don't announce something at an all-hands with 2,000 people without expecting that it's going to be leaked.” </p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/business/bolt-layoffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1534872800439279618" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/07/01/homelight-lays-off-a-fifth-of-its-workers-weeks-after-raising-60m/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HomeLight</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/stord-slashes-jobs-after-new-funding-5884514/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stord</a> all drew attention from funding announcements that happened just weeks or days before layoffs.

Plus, big funding announcements don’t always equate to a company’s financial health. Travel startup <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/05/31/pollen-reported-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pollen</a> cut staff after raising funding and collapsed just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/the-next-fyre-fest-startup-pollen-leaves-people-seeking-refunds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three months later</a>. </p><p>Though it’s impossible to know the financial guts of a company from the outside, many will conduct layoffs to extend their runway, Anthony Kline, partner at The GP, told Protocol. Prior to the recent downturn, venture capitalists were “seeing a bit of a gold rush” in tech. But as things have slowed, funding rounds have become harder and harder to come by. “You're able to see the caboose now; you're not gonna see, like, an infinite line of cars.” </p><p>As the economy shifted, so did the role of the founder and CEO, Kline said, changing from “growth product leader to resource allocator.” Jobs that don’t directly align with generating revenue or are duplicate roles are first on the chopping block.</p><p>“If they don't assume that there's some additional round of funding that’s 12 months out, it might be 24 or 36 months out, then they have to be a little bit more creative and a little bit more resourceful,” Kline said. </p><h3>It sucks no matter what</h3><p>It’s difficult to predict if a company will have rocky times ahead, but smart leaders can plan ahead about when to announce funding. If the announcement comes months or a year after closing the round, it gives the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. And, optics aside, layoffs after funding announcements (and in general) are a blow to internal morale. Doing them in a transparent and thoughtful way is crucial. </p><p>Having employees be in the know about company details, financial standing, and what the future of the company looks like might help ease the blow of layoffs. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Kline. </p><p>Being present with your staff amid layoffs, especially in a time of increased remote work, is important to let employees know you’re not disconnected and you’re listening to how layoffs impact them. </p><p>“You see a lot of situations where a founder is so preoccupied with allocating resources, talking to investors, or talking to customers, that they're spending most of their time externally and less so internally,” Kline said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Gary Gensler is keeping up with Kim Kardashian https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/kim-kardashian-emax-crypto-sec Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:23:09 +0000

Kim Kardashian <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax" target="_self">agreed to pay a $1.26 million penalty</a> for failing to report that she got paid to endorse EMAX tokens. It’s a high-profile affirmation of the SEC’s controversial position that most cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities, and just like stock promoters, celebrities better follow the rules if they want to pitch a token to the public.</p><p><strong>Disclosure rules. </strong>“Ms. Kardashian’s case” is a reminder that celebrities must “disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities" like crypto tokens, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183" target="_blank">Gensler said</a>.</p><ul><li>The SEC had actually put out this warning even before Gensler’s time in the wake of the ICO craze a few years ago. In 2017, the regulator cautioned investors <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-potentially-unlawful-promotion-icos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“to be wary of investment opportunities</a> that sound too good to be true” and of “paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons.”</li><li>The following year the SEC announced that boxer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled</a> agreed to pay “disgorgement, penalties and interest” for failing to report that they got paid for touting initial coin offerings. </li></ul><p><strong>The cases underline the perils of celebrity endorsements in the world of investment finance,</strong> where “you can't be paid to promote a stock without disclosing that you're being paid,” Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco regional director, told Protocol. </p><ul><li>Online influencers make a living on hype. But in the world of securities, “overexuberance without proper disclosures and disclaimers is going to be considered misleading and is going to get people in hot water,” Andrew Lom, global head of private wealth at Norton Rose Fulbright, told Protocol. </li><li>Mike Fasanello, chief compliance officer at LVL, said “a seasoned businesswoman like Ms. Kardashian really should have known better considering her career is built largely on advertising and her public image.”</li></ul><p><strong>It’s a significant PR moment for the SEC. </strong>While the regulator has gone after other offending crypto celebrities, the Kardashian case is a “bigger win,” Fagel argued.</p><ul><li>She’s a huge celebrity, after all, whose popularity extends beyond the crypto and finance realms. “There are a lot more people reading about Kim Kardashian” than scouring other cases and news stories involving crypto, he told Protocol. The federal government “has an interest in bringing high-profile cases as a deterrent matter because it gets a lot more attention.”</li><li>In fact, the Kardashian case “may turn into the best public service announcement not to take investment advice from a celebrity,” Bill Callahan, director of government strategic affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. It could also serve as a “warning to others that they must settle their investigations by the SEC” and other law enforcement agencies.</li><li>The fine Kardashian has to pay is “a nominal penalty considering her overall net worth,” Fasanello said. But the SEC action “is meant to educate the masses rather than to penalize the individual.”</li></ul><p>“Simply being a crypto enthusiast publicly isn't going to get anyone in trouble,” even among celebrities, Melody Brue of Moor Insights & Strategy told Protocol. In other words, Matt Damon is probably off the hook for saying that “fortune favors the brave” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crypto.com ad</a>. But trying to make money from touting crypto products is a serious matter, Brue added: “However vague you believe crypto as a security rule to be, it's clear Gensler is going to apply the same regulations, disclosure requirements, and marketing rules that are applied to securities.” </p><p><em>— Benjamin Pimentel (</em><a href="mailto:bpimentel@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="http://twitter.com/benpimentel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM ALIBABA</h3><br/><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="8959dd775f8b0d912fadd71e203ba533" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123996622&iu=/21901267728" id="daa0e" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843641&width=980"/></a><p>Alibaba — a leading global ecommerce company — is a particularly powerful engine in helping American businesses of every size sell goods to more than 1 billion consumers on its digital marketplaces in China.

The outcome could make or break an industry increasingly central to tech companies meeting their net zero goals.</p><p>Globally, Verra — short for the Verified Carbon Standard — issues roughly two-thirds of the carbon credits on the voluntary market, including credits for renewable energy and forestry and land use, among other types. Established in 2007, the registry is the longtime face of the market’s status quo.</p><p>But as demand has surged for carbon credits — particularly as the tech industry looks to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-offsets-shopping-ecommerce" target="_self">meet its net zero targets</a> by offsetting a (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/tech-climate-plan-tips?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">small</a>) portion of its emissions — it has become increasingly clear that scaling the credit market will first require clear standards and transparency. In fact, this is precisely the conclusion that forced a 400-member industry task force on scaling the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/carney-s-bid-to-boost-carbon-market-scaled-back-amid-controversy?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to change tack</a> in 2021. In its wake, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market emerged. It published proposed reforms — including establishing an agreed-upon definition for credit quality and evaluating methodologies accordingly — in July. </p><p>While Verra initially supported the effort, it has since taken issue with the specifics of even these modest potential reforms. Last week, the organization demanded that the council make a “course correction” and took particular issue with the approach that gives credit types that meet the quality definition a thumbs-up in a note to stakeholders.</p><p>“We especially fear that the principles-based review of programs has been supplanted with a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach that seeks to directly set the scope and rules of the market,” Verra wrote in mid-September. Verra also argued for program-by-program evaluation rather than one that evaluates the quality of specific credit types.</p><p>In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/verra-integrity-council" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new analysis</a>, the climate research nonprofit CarbonPlan said Verra’s objection was “melodramatic” and “about control.” </p><p>“The Integrity Council is running a voluntary, opt-in labeling effort — nothing more,” the CarbonPlan team wrote last week. “The Integrity Council isn’t proposing to do anything about credits that fall short of its standards, nor is it clear how they could if they wanted to.”</p><p>Carbon markets are essentially the Wild West. Countless methodologies exist to define what makes for a quality credit, and imposing order on any lawless frontier is proving to be a challenge. But the stakes couldn’t be higher. </p><p>A <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/reform-needed-to-unlock-550-billion-carbon-offsets-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF analysis</a> found that the carbon offset market could be worth as much as $550 billion by 2050, a time period when net zero commitments will come due. However, absent global standard-setting, it is possible that there won’t be enough quality offsets to keep up to the demand. That could mean a lot of money gets wasted on ineffective credits while causing the planet to overheat to dangerous levels. </p><p>The fact that this initial attempt does not have the support of the voluntary market’s biggest player does not bode well. CarbonPlan speculated that at the root of Verra’s objection is a concern that its credits are not “robust enough” to meet the benchmark set out by the council’s proposal, and that new standards “could threaten their dominant position on the supply side of the voluntary market.”</p><p>Verra, for its part, maintains that its concerns are with the process’s efficiency, not with its proposed scrutiny. </p><p>“We don’t wish to see good projects unable to move ahead because the methodology they are using is waiting too long in line for its assessment,” Andrew Howard, Verra’s senior director for climate policy and strategy, told Protocol. “Verra is confident the VCS program will meet the ICVCM’s quality thresholds.”</p><p>Verra proposed several specific “course corrections” for the council, ostensibly with efficiency in mind. First, it argued for evaluating entire programs rather than specific credit types or methodologies. CarbonPlan said that approach “doesn’t pass the laugh test” given that it would force the council to give the whole swath of Verra credits a thumbs-up without acknowledging how much, for instance, a renewable energy credit’s methodology might differ from that of a forestry credit. </p><p>“That is no way to confront the well-documented challenges in the voluntary carbon markets, many of which are present in Verra’s offerings, and it would force the Integrity Council to either bless most of the market uncritically or categorically exclude its largest player,” CarbonPlan said. </p><p>In response, Verra said the council should sample or use spot checks to make sure all of a program’s credit types deserve the council’s approval, but that relying on a methodology-by-methodology evaluation rather than more efficient approaches would leave the council at risk of “seriously bogged down.” </p><p>Verra also took issue with the proposal to step up standards over time and suggested that the council use existing aviation industry offset standards. Taking that approach, though, would ignore the very real need for sharper offset standards and the reality that the aviation industry’s standards are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-un-just-made-it-easier-for-airlines-to-pollute-1844251411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rife with loopholes</a>.</p><p>Regardless of what shape the council’s final reforms take, though, Verra doesn’t have to participate in the council’s proposed benchmarking if it doesn’t want to. If the registry does opt out, it would seriously undermine the scope of any new standards by making two in three carbon credits exempt. </p><p>That puts the council in the midst of a tug-of-war as Verra pulls it to change its plan and CarbonPlan and its other supporters urge it to stay the course. Should the council allow itself to be swayed by Verra’s concerns, CarbonPlan said it could put its very independence at risk.</p><p>“Either [the council members] accede to Verra’s demands and abandon any claim to independence, or they forge ahead and work with only a minority of the current market,” CarbonPlan <a href="https://twitter.com/carbonplanorg/status/1575549005265653760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summarized via Twitter</a>. “We hope they will choose the latter.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={White House AI Bill of Rights lacks specific recommendations for AI rules https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights Tue, 04 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

And, linking to an article about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveillance tech used in China</a> to track and control the Muslim minority Uyghur population there, they alluded to use of AI by autocracies “as a tool of state-sponsored oppression, division, and discrimination.”</p><p class="pull-quote">I categorically reject that kind of framing of it,” Nelson told Protocol. “The document moves as the title says from principles to practice.</p><p>Soon after the announcement, OSTP held several <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public listening sessions</a> in November 2021 on AI-enabled biometric technologies, consumer and “smart city” products, and AI used for employment, education, housing, health care, social welfare, financial services, and in the criminal justice system.</p><p>While some advocacy groups have indicated <a href="https://www.caidp.org/statements/ostp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustration with the slow process</a> for publishing the AI Bill of Rights, Nelson said by one measure — the Biden-Harris administration’s <a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Summit for Democracy</a> held in December 2021 — it is actually early. <br/><br/>“We had committed by December to finish this, and we are completing it with a little bit of time to spare,” Nelson said.</p><p>Scandal has plagued OSTP this year. Former OSTP Director <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/eric-lander-resigns-00006545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lander resigned In February</a> amid accusations he created “an atmosphere of intimidation at OSTP through flagrant verbal abuse.” Later in March, POLITICO revealed that Lander had helped enable an organization led by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to pay the salaries of some OSTP staff.<br/><br/></a>Lawmakers have proposed legislation that would take ethical commitments made by the government out of the realm of theory and into practice. Legislation introduced in February, for example, would <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/revised-algorithmic-accountability-bill-ai" target="_self">require companies to assess the impact of AI</a> and automated systems they use to make decisions affecting people’s employment, finances, and housing and require those companies to submit annual reports about assessments to the FTC.</p><p>Despite a lack of federal AI laws or regulations, the U.S. has agreed to uphold international <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles established in 2019 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> that call on makers and users of AI systems to be held accountable for them, and ensure they respect human rights and democratic values including privacy, non-discrimination, fairness, and labor rights. Those principles also called on AI builders and users to make sure that the systems are transparent, provide understandable and traceable explanations for their decisions, and are safe and secure.</p><p>In conjunction with the publication of the AI Bill of Rights, other federal agencies are expected to signal commitment to take actions reflective of its tenets. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services plans to release recommendations for methods to reduce algorithmic discrimination in health care AI and the Department of Education is planning to release recommendations on the use of AI for teaching and learning by early 2023.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The US is set to expand controls on chip tech for China this week https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/us-china-chips-export-controls Mon, 03 Oct 2022 23:01:22 +0000

Thursday’s announcement is expected to include export controls on chipmaking tools.</p><p>In late August, Nvidia and AMD disclosed they had received notification letters from the Commerce Department ordering them to halt sales of chips designed for artificial intelligence computing.

High-bandwidth memory (which is useful for training large AI models) and flash were among the memory technologies under consideration, the people said. </p><p>Administration officials had been briefed by several memory manufacturers about establishing specific thresholds for flash and high-bandwidth memory, according to another person familiar with the discussions.

The stakes for the legal status quo underpinning the entirety of modern social media are potentially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/texas-elon-musk-free-speech?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">huge</a>, and the outcome is far from certain.</p><p><strong>The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/supreme-court-scrutinize-us-protections-social-media-2022-10-03/" target="_blank">said</a> it will hear <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gonzalez-v-google-llc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a case</a> involving terrorist content on YouTube and whether or not Section 230 immunizes platforms’ algorithms.</strong></p><ul><li>Section 230, of course, says that web platforms, from newspaper comment sections and email providers to Big Tech platforms like Google, can’t be sued over posts that are “provided by another” — a.k.a., by users.</li><li>One of the many, many questions swirling around this law is, when do platforms become so involved with the content that they cease to be separate from users, and can be sued?</li><li>Is it when they were alerted to content by user reports? How about when they promote the content through algorithms? When they add their own warning about it?</li></ul><p><strong>Up until now, federal districts and appeals courts have basically ruled “no” to all of the above,</strong> reasoning that if any were the case, platforms would have to either check almost every single post or ignore all of them.</p><ul><li>Both extremes would be bad for business — a big concern at the dawn of the internet age, in 1996, when the law passed.</li><li>Checking every post (and taking down all the ones that raise any worry of even frivolous litigation) obviously would be bad for free speech.</li><li>But creating a free-for-all would make platforms intensely toxic. The moderation that platforms <em>do</em> do is both arguably both <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/meta-midterms-global-democracy-2023" target="_self">insufficient</a> and also the only thing making some platforms tolerable. </li></ul><p>Under that legal approach, the algorithms that order and recommend content — which, from a technological point of view, are basically the entire point and purpose of social media — <strong>don’t create lawsuit risk for the platforms.</strong></p><ul><li>Nor do fact-checks, labels, failures to act on warnings, and lots of other things.</li><li>It’s not just takedowns and other forms of moderation: Leaving content up and doing nothing with it is also completely fine, under the law.</li></ul><p>Of course, <strong>there’s bipartisan anger that this setup creates huge levels of harm without recourse for those who got hurt, even as some tech companies have gotten very rich.</strong></p><ul><li>Much of that anger focuses on harm that happens at algorithmic scale — whether it’s the spread of child sexual abuse material or mass harassment — because of boosting by Big Tech companies’ very <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/design-wars-ca" target="_self">own</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/california-privacy-transparency?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">designs</a>.</li><li>The case — and an additional case the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/twitter-inc-v-taamneh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will hear</a> involving Twitter — involves terrorist content and attacks, and could offer SCOTUS the ability to narrow court interpretation about just how free social services are to be, well, what they are.</li><li>There may be <a href="https://twitter.com/jkosseff/status/1576934189643239424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real appetite</a> for that kind of narrowing, in fact: The justices appear to have taken up the issue despite the lack of any disagreement in circuit courts, which is more often what <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/section-230-snap" target="_self">prompts</a> them to hear a case.</li></ul><p>By the way, if you thought it was a different issue that touched on Section 230 and seemed <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/hb20-fifth-circuit-stay" target="_self">destined for the Supreme Court</a> — namely,<strong> whether states can require platforms to host conservative content — the justices still could take that up too.</strong></p><p><strong>Both sets of cases create huge uncertainty for tech, though of course a ruling confirming the status quo is possible in both.</strong></p><ul><li>The court may also decide to rule narrowly and only find a small loophole for existing statutes on terrorist content.</li><li>Maybe the justices will follow the framing of the Twitter case and sidestep algorithms altogether, focusing instead on liability in anti-terrorism law.</li><li>But the breadth of potential questions is staggering here, including free speech and design.</li></ul><p>And unlike most of the contentious issues, where the ideological lineup of the court is a good predictor of the outcome, <strong>Section 230 has <a href="https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1576933341894705152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foes</a> and defenders on both sides, and for the most part, we don’t know where the nine justices fall.</strong></p><ul><li>The one exception is arch-conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-section-230" target="_self">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-230-meta" target="_self">called</a> for narrowing when companies get to benefit from the law and for expanding the circumstances where they’re responsible for content.</li></ul><p>I wrote a few weeks ago that the possibility of the Supreme Court taking up the Florida and Texas laws had a real “<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/texas-scotus-issues?rebelltitem=4" target="_self">season finale</a>” vibe — no one knows what’s going to happen and seemingly everything is on the table.

Microsoft Solutions Partners also can earn specializations and expert program status that recognize their expertise and experience in specific technical scenarios under each solution area. </p><p>“What I think is unique about the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is it gives customers total clarity on the partner that has the designations, the specializations that are a great fit for their needs for whatever unique cloud solutions they’re looking for or the transformation that they’re trying to get after,” Dezen said. “It’s like a clear road map, so to speak.”</p><p>A 12-year Microsoft veteran, Dezen most recently served as corporate vice president of device partner sales.

What this means for partners is that they get to differentiate themselves in a very competitive market to customers.</p><p>It’s a really important moment to showcase to partners that we are evolving … as the market is evolving, and we are introducing new capabilities in our programs that let partners focus on their own innovation, leverage our R&D investments, and help customers. The program makes it very easy for partners to understand the things that they need to do to activate all of the resources that we uniquely deliver to partners, whether that’s our R&D investments, our go-to-market scale and capability, or innovation.</p><p>Partners can plug in via skilling, incentives, [or] investments to make sure that they’re getting the best of what I think is Microsoft’s unique differentiation, which is our tech stack plus the combination of the way we go to market, which is the asset of our commercial marketplace combined with our 35,000 [Microsoft field] sellers.</p><p><strong>What’s been the reaction among partners?</strong></p><p>We’ve spent the last six months talking to partners, listening to their feedback, answering their questions. I’m really optimistic that the partners are excited about what we’re doing. They’re excited about the [timing] of this. They see that the portfolio of assets that we’re bringing together with a trusted platform, services, products, and investments for them are so aligned to the way that customers are actually buying products. And it’s aligned to the way that Microsoft sells, so it’s an accelerant for the partners.</p><p><strong>What percentage of partners have decided to join the new program versus renewing their legacy statuses for a year?</strong></p><p>We’re not disclosing specific numbers, but what I will say is partners have the ability to start earning designations immediately. And for partners that aren’t quite ready — first of all, we’re leaning in with resources to help partners make that shift — but they can continue to enjoy their competency benefits uninterrupted through their annual term. They can even renew those benefits after the Silver and Gold badges have retired.</p><p>When Microsoft announced the new program in March, it said partners’ preliminary partner capability scores would be available then, and they had to achieve at least 70 points out of 100 to earn a designation. What percentage of partners needed Microsoft’s help in getting to 70 points?</p><p>Every partner is in a different place on their journey. We have broad-reaching guidance through our partner center that tells partners exactly how they can improve their score in the different categories: performance, skilling, and customer success. Partners can start earning those designations immediately. There are some partners that are well on their way. </p><p>Partners still remain our partners regardless of their designation, and so we’re always going to look for ways to support our partners through any evolutions that are happening with us and in the market. I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are. But I really believe that this program is the thing that’s going to differentiate partners, and so it’s in our interest, in our partners’ interest, and frankly, in the customers’ interests, for partners to lean in and do this work with us.</p><p><strong>The economy has tumbled since Microsoft announced the changes that take effect today. Were any considerations given to partners that might be experiencing economic challenges?</strong></p><p>I actually think the time is better than ever. This is a challenging market, there’s no question about it, but customers need help. They need help to digitally transform, and it’s in their economic interest to do that. We’re giving partners the skills, the resources, the assets, and the partnership to enable them to show customers how they can run their businesses more cost-effectively digitally.</p><p class="pull-quote">I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the changes coming with the industry designations for ISVs?</strong></p><p>There are actually two immediate investments that we’re making around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/program-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ISV Success</a>, which is the pathway for ISVs within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, and then the industry designations. Those are going to be available later this year. They will differentiate solutions based on the demonstrated performance with customers, their technical maturity, and customer success. The first three industries are health care, retail, and financial services. It’s designed with the intent that it will help these ISVs differentiate their solutions by both industry-specific scenarios as well as the broader technology and line-of-business capabilities.</p><p><strong>Can you give a sneak peek of anything else that’s coming after these changes?</strong></p><p>The way to think about it is the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is designed for every partner. We want to invite every partner to participate in it. So the things that you could expect to see in the future are more design capabilities for partners like device partners, mixed-reality partners, learning partners, success partners. We’ll have more specific capabilities roll out as we advance the program.</p><p><strong>What are some common problems or challenges that partners have communicated to you?</strong></p><p>Partners are deciding how quickly they can evolve and modernize their businesses. That’s pretty core to the discussions that we have with partners all the time: How can we help them? How can we help them make more money? How can we help them run thriving, profitable businesses to help their own employees?</p><p>We just published [Microsoft-commissioned research] <a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/microsoft-ecosystem-value-new-data-reveals-partner-paths-to-profitability-and-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from IDC</a>. It’s a great illustration: It talks about how partners that invest with Microsoft see distinct business value and growth. There’s really two things that popped for me. One was that partners that engage deeply with Microsoft see faster growth and higher margins. Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year. The second one is around co-selling and going to market with us. The research showed that the most successful partners we have are engaging across the variety of go-to-market resources with us. These are partners that develop differentiated, value-added approaches to customers that align with Microsoft’s strategy. </p><p class="pull-quote">Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year.</p><p><strong>Are there any emerging technology areas where you’d like to see more partners investing in?</strong></p><p>I’d like to see more partners in all of our solution areas. The party’s open. There are some things that are very timely: certainly security, data, and AI. These are very hot and relevant topics for customers right now, and so that’s pretty core to the conversations that we’re having with our partners.</p><p><strong>Are you going to get involved in trying to bring more female-led partners into the program and promoting greater diversity overall?</strong></p><p>I have a massive responsibility to be a loud voice for diversity and representation in the ecosystem. Any things that we can do to help more diverse partner types participate in our programs, build their own businesses with Microsoft, and then help customers, for me that’s not just a professional win, it’s a personal one.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Tech recruiters' best tips for sourcing talent on LinkedIn https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/best-practices-linkedin-talent-sourcing Mon, 03 Oct 2022 16:54:39 +0000

Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p><hr/><p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul><p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul><p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul><p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul></ul><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Kim Kardashian will pay $1.26 million over crypto post, SEC says https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax Mon, 03 Oct 2022 13:05:05 +0000

Since then the landscape for productivity startups trying to make it on their own has completely changed, especially for those pandemic darlings that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=16f2286b6490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flourished in the all-remote world</a>. </p><p>As recession looms, companies looking to cut costs are less likely to spend money on tools outside of their Microsoft or Google workplace bundles. Enterprise platforms are bulking up and it could spell trouble for the productivity startups trying to unseat them. But Notion COO Akshay Kothari says the company is still aiming to build the next Microsoft, not be the next Microsoft. And in a move signaling a new chapter of maturity, Notion has hired its first chief financial officer: Rama Katkar, Instacart’s former VP of finance.</p><p>Figma, which Kothari called a “sister company” to Notion, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/adobe-to-acquire-figma" target="_self">decided to join Adobe</a> for $20 billion instead of beating them. But Notion is hungry for more. Unlike other startups that have pared down during the downturn, Notion has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-flowdash-acquisition-tender-offer" target="_self">gone on the offensive</a> with acquisitions of calendar app Cron and workflow app Flowdash, as well as launching a global ad campaign. Notion also retained its valuation after <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sequoia-index-purchase-shares-from-notion-employees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees sold shares to investors in a tender offer</a>. Kothari said he doesn’t feel Notion has to “entertain any discussions” about being acquired; there’s more room for Notion to grow, he said, both in the consumer and enterprise spaces. </p><p>“It's almost not worth thinking about the hypotheticals because there's just so much that is left to be done, that we could do ourselves,” Kothari said. </p><h3>IPO or no? </h3><p>Katkar’s hire is a sign Notion may even go public in the near future. The CFO has some experience in this area (Katkar prepped Instacart for its impending, and lately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instacart-plans-to-focus-ipo-on-selling-employee-shares-11663581602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat troubled</a>, IPO.) When Protocol asked about Notion’s IPO plans, she didn’t commit to a “yes” or “no.” Instead, Katkar said Notion is “focused on building” and tackling the international knowledge worker market. </p><p>Whenever a late-stage private company hires a CFO, that means they’re thinking about “the next step,” Wing Venture Capital partner Zach DeWitt said. Going public is typically this next step, and so hiring a CFO with public company or IPO-readiness experience is the way to go. “Usually around $5 million of revenue is when a company starts talking about a VP of finance,” DeWitt said. “By the time the company has $50 million of ARR, they should definitely have a CFO, in the majority of cases.”</p><p>At Instacart and before that at Credit Karma, Katkar developed the financial processes and functions necessary for a maturing company. These IPO-readiness skills apply to private companies too, she noted. </p><p>“That concept of public company readiness is just a framework,” Katkar said. “But in reality, I think even large private companies benefit from operating that way.”</p><p>Katkar was the No. 2 financial officer at both Instacart and Credit Karma, and she feels ready to take on the CFO role. Notion was at the top of her list for its simultaneous consumer and enterprise focus, Katkar said. </p><h3>B to C to B</h3><p>Kothari describes Notion as a “B2C2B” company. Notion doesn’t target CIOs, but rather consumers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-conference-enterprise-productivity-influencer" target="_self">who then work to formalize Notion</a> inside their companies, the so-called <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/cio-shadow-it-saas" target="_self">shadow IT</a> or, in Notion world, “Notion Champions.” Lately, Notion has been working on making its product more translatable for large companies, adding <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-08-29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more admin controls and specific workspaces for teams</a>. But Kothari said he’s not forcing Notion into the enterprise at this point. </p><p>“Eventually, we'll get to a point where we can actually go up to the CIO of a company, who's never heard of Notion, and convince them to roll out Notion company-wide,” Kothari said. “But most of the work right now is happening through the employees, through the community.”</p><p>Notion’s ad campaign, with billboards in London, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco, emphasizes the note-taking tool’s ability to help organize personal life, not just work. Kothari also pointed to the company’s New York City and San Francisco pop-up stands offering bucket hats and coffee as part of the broader brand campaign. This type of branding, as well as the company’s investment in and popularity on TikTok, helps target Gen Z and students who might become Notion worker-champions someday. </p><p>“We can put our energy into making sure our consumers get to use the product for free because we know that downstream, that leads to a B2B business being built in the long run,” Kothari said. </p><p>But Notion’s B2B approach is ultimately not as strong when going up against enterprise software giants with stronger distribution models. DeWitt pointed out that Notion’s valuation is similar to Figma’s at $10 billion, making it a potential candidate for a lucrative acquisition someday. “I’m sure there are some large companies, like Microsoft would be a natural buyer here, maybe even Salesforce, that are thinking about potentially acquiring Notion,” DeWitt said. “It’s a great category, a great team, a great product. It’s got a lot of momentum.”</p><p>Kothari said he feels a close kinship with Figma, as the two companies had similar growth trajectories and similar <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/adobe-figma-dylan-field-user-reactions" target="_self">obsessive, loyal user bases</a>. He’s known CEO Dylan Field for over a decade. The Adobe deal shows “how much existing legacy companies really appreciate the power of these new businesses,” Kothari said. </p><p>Kothari has been through acquisitions twice, with LinkedIn buying his content platform Pulse, and then Microsoft buying LinkedIn. Kothari said it’s not in the cards for Notion, at least not right now. </p><p>“When [Notion CEO] Ivan was recruiting me, he said, do you want to work at Microsoft or do you want to build the next Microsoft?” Kothari said. “I’m personally excited about continuing to build here and seeing if we can continue to remain independent.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Securing the enterprise https://www.protocol.com/manuals/securing-the-enterprise/ Mon, 03 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

Another 23% have too thin a credit file to score or no file at all. That puts them in a credit trap: To build credit, these consumers need someone to give them a line of credit with which they can demonstrate good financial habits. But with scores that low, few lenders are prepared to offer them anything. </p><p>Neobanks say they can solve the problem through a new twist on secured credit cards. But regulators are already scrutinizing their offerings.</p><p>Secured credit cards have been an answer to the thin-credit problem <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/build-credit-with-secured-credit-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for decades</a> because they allow subprime borrowers to open a line of credit when they otherwise can’t by depositing cash upfront. That sum determines the borrower’s credit limit, and gives the banks collateral to hold on to in case of default. However, most require several hundred dollars as a deposit and impose <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp#:~:text=Secured%20credit%20cards%20generally%20come,lower%2Dcost%20forms%20of%20credit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty interest rates and fees</a>, which low-income borrowers struggle to afford.</p><h3>Payback time?</h3><p>Neobanks say they can avoid those problems and still help users build credit through secured credit cards that allow customers to repay their credit balance directly using their deposited cash, rather than keeping that money set aside. The products allow customers to build credit while paying for everyday expenses, neobanks say, without having to save up extra cash first. </p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank describe it as a win-win for consumers and fintechs — consumers can raise their credit scores, and the neobanks earn loyal customers. </p><p>But some in the industry see red flags. “They are, functionally, prepaid credit cards,” fintech analyst Alex Johnson told Protocol. That raises the concern that neobanks may be helping users increase their credit score with a tool that doesn't actually indicate their ability to repay. “If I was a lender, I’d be pissed about having to untangle the trade lines in these consumers’ credit files in order to make sure I wasn’t mistakenly granting credit to high-risk applicants.”</p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards each have similar mechanics: First, a user moves money from a checking account into a separate credit-builder account. The amount of money they move determines their credit limit: If a user moves $200 into the credit-builder account, they can spend up to $200 on a linked secured credit card. Then, at the end of the payment period, users can pay off their credit card balances with the money they’ve deposited — in this example, that same $200. Both Varo and Chime also allow users to sign up for automatic payments. </p><p>Varo and GO2bank told Protocol that it’s that third step — having to pay off the credit card at the end of the payment period — that makes the cards credit cards, not prepaid debit cards. Late payment or failure to repay can damage users’ credit scores. GO2bank additionally charges up to $39 for a late payment. Chime declined to answer any questions for this story. </p><p>With this distinction, neobanks are subject to regulations that govern credit but not debit cards, like the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_truth-in-lending-act.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth in Lending Act</a>. They also, crucially, can market the cards as credit-building tools. The companies make 1% to 2% more in interchange on credit cards than they do on debit cards, <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-marshall-introduce-bipartisan-credit-card-competition-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though pending legislation</a> may curb these fees.</p><p>Visa, on whose network Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards are issued, did not respond to questions about whether the cards resemble prepaid debit cards. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion also did not respond to questions about whether the cards accurately indicate customers’ ability to repay. </p><p>Varo and Go2Bank both say they are not worried about pending legislation changing the amount they can charge on interchange because the credit-building products are not a core source of profit. Rather, representatives of both banks told Protocol the product serves to help them meet customer needs and thus build goodwill with their users. “We’re building deeper connections and deeper engagement,” Raktim Mitra, Varo’s head of credit cards, told Protocol. </p><p>The CFPB acknowledged Varo and Chime’s secured credit-builder products in its <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-credit-card-market-report_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Consumer Credit Card Market Report</a>, without mentioning whether the products might deserve further scrutiny. When Protocol asked the bureau for an update on its views, a spokesperson said that “the CFPB is aware of this market development, and we are monitoring this issue closely.” </p><h3>A spot of ambiguity</h3><p>For consumer advocates, the ambiguity around such programs is a symptom of a larger problem: The CFPB has yet to bring neobanks fully under its regulatory purview. Under the law that created it, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-examinations/institutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bureau can supervise</a> financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets and certain participants in consumer financial markets, like those that work in consumer reporting, debt collection, or the servicing of some loans. </p><p>The bureau invoked a dormant authority to investigate nonbank fintechs in April of this year, though consumer advocates <a href="https://consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFPB-CFA%20Fact-Sheet-CFPB-and-non-banks.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been advocating</a> for more regular and thorough supervision. “There’s no accountability as of right now,” said Rachel Gittleman, head of financial services outreach at the Consumer Federation of America. </p><p>Gittleman’s primary concern with the credit-builders is that consumers may not understand they are using a lending product, despite the terms and conditions laid out in fine print. Though Chime, Varo, and GO2bank each market their products explicitly as secured credit cards, they <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/varo-bank-introduces-varo-believe-a-new-and-better-way-for-millions-of-americans-to-build-credit-301235475.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downplay</a> possible negative impacts on a customer’s credit, and automatic payment options make the products feel more like a regular debit card that doesn’t have default risk.

Today, we’re learning the best ways to source talent on LinkedIn — especially if you’re short on time and resources (read: recruiters). Plus, we’re reading Elon’s text messages from Larry Ellison, Jason Calicanis, and Joe Rogan.</em></p><p class=""><em>— Allison Levitsky, reporter (</em><a href="mailto:alevitsky@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Levitskyyy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>LinkedIn recruiting secrets</h3><br/><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/technology/meta-hiring-freeze.html" target="_blank">Meta</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/27/lyft-freezes-all-us-hiring-amid-stock-slump-economic-downturn/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> have stopped hiring for the year, and that’s music to the ears of other tech companies that are still staffing up. Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p>
<p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><h3>'Haha cool'</h3><br/><p>The world got a glimpse into Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" target="_blank">text inbox</a> this week thanks to his ongoing legal battle with Twitter. Now we know what tech’s power brokers really want: for Twitter to be an “open source protocol” rather than a company (Jack Dorsey), for Musk to move Twitter’s headquarters to Austin and force employees back to the office (Jason Calacanis), and a 24-hour edit button (Gayle King).</p>
<p>Larry Ellison, Reid Hoffman, and Joe Rogan are in there, too. </p>

So what’s next? According to Miller, the next era, including the rivalry between the U.S. and China, is all about computing power.</p><p>That tech rivalry and the story of how the chip industry got from four to 11.8 billion transistors are all part of Miller’s book, “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” which comes out Oct. 4. “Chip War” outlines the nature of the coming battle over semiconductors, showing how the power to produce leading-edge chips fell into the hands of just five companies: three from the U.S., one from Japan, and one from the Netherlands. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Miller touched on the evolving military uses of semiconductors, Russia’s chip procurement problems, and whether onshoring chips won’t necessarily increase the likelihood of a conflict between the U.S. and China. </p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>You write about how the Persian Gulf War became a pivotal moment for understanding the role microchips would play in warfare, especially with guided missiles. Are missiles still the use-case where the military needs the most advanced chips, or has that shifted to other areas like artificial intelligence or cyber attacks?</strong></p><p>I wouldn't necessarily think about individual weapon systems. Chips are important in those weapon systems, but there's also the broader integration of sensors to decision-makers, communication technologies, [and] weapon systems — all of which rely on chips of different sorts. </p><p>So it's the integration that matters as much as the capabilities of any individual system. But as more and more systems start to become more autonomous, the demands for computing power, memory, and communication bandwidth increase on all of these systems. </p><p>So yes, semiconductors are still very important in terms of advances in specific types of munitions, but it's also [about] the ability to integrate them, to transfer information between them, and to have them working together — and all that requires advanced semiconductors at every stage of the process. Militaries are confronting semiconductors everywhere they turn, and their ability to access the right types of semiconductors and more advanced chips is crucial for every aspect of the modern battlefield.</p><p><strong>What’s Russia’s status with the ability to procure semiconductors? There were reports that Russia was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-chips-are-down-russia-hunts-western-parts-to-run-its-war-machines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggling to access</a> chips for the Ukraine conflict. </strong></p><p>Russia does have some domestic chipmaking capacity but it's very, very limited, both in terms of the level of advancement — which is not that advanced — but also in terms of capacity. </p><p>What we've learned from the war — which confirms what we presumed before the war — is that, when you take apart the Russian military system, you'll find lots of foreign-produced chips, and often American-produced chips, inside. Many of these chips are off the shelf — things that you can acquire commercially.</p><p>In some ways, the fact that every military in the world is trying to use commercial chips in their systems has been an equalizing factor. But for Russia, it has presented some challenges too. Russia never really knows whether the chips it's buying have been sabotaged in any way. Every country has that to a certain extent. But the U.S., for example, is relying on chip fabs in the U.S. or in friendly countries — whereas Russia is relying almost exclusively on chips produced in unfriendly countries.</p><p>The systems integration capabilities are also lacking in Russia. They've got some, but there's just a lot more expertise in places like the U.S. or in East Asian countries [for] how you bring different types of chips plus software plus the hardware all together in a coherent system. And I think that's also somewhere we've seen Russia face some difficulties.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo courtesy of Chris Miller</small></p><p><strong>How successful do you think the Chips Plus Act will be? </strong></p><p>There's a question about getting the most bang for our buck out of the Chips Act fund. I think there are ways we can get more or less lucky on that front. But I don't think there's really a serious argument that the Chips Act funding is not going to increase the amount of leading-edge chipmaking capacity in the U.S. We've already seen a number of new facilities being built on the expectations of those funds.</p><p><strong>Does onshoring chip production increase the chances of conflict between the U.S. and China? It seems the U.S. is onshoring production in anticipation of greater conflict, but is it also possible it increases the chances of something happening by reducing the cost of conflict?</strong></p><p>This sort of mutually assured economic destruction thesis — the idea that the U.S. and China or China and Taiwan could never find themselves in a conflict because it would be too costly to do — I think history provides many examples of times in which economically integrated countries ended up in conflict. So that's one reason to be skeptical of it.</p><p>The second reason is that the assumption that was true for most of the period from Deng Xiaoping forward in China — that Chinese leaders were primarily focused on maximizing GDP — that assumption is no longer valid. The last three years of Chinese policy have not been about maximizing GDP but about political goals and zero COVID. It doesn't mean that they're not going to care at all about economic issues. But we shouldn't assume that either China or the U.S. or Taiwan is approaching these issues solely from the perspective of making sure trading continues unharmed.</p><p>The lesson of 2022 is not that economically integrated powers can't quickly decouple, because we've seen that in a shocking way between Russia and Europe. So I don't think we should take much comfort in the fact that there's a lot of economic integration between China, Taiwan, the U.S., and other countries in the sense that is going to guarantee a peaceful outcome. I don't think history suggests that's true.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Big Tech’s facade is crumbling https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/hiring-freeze-downturn-big-tech Sun, 02 Oct 2022 10:00:00 +0000

As part of this, we occasionally reprioritize the roles we need to fill and offer similar roles to candidates with pending offers,” the company told Protocol in an emailed statement. </li><li>Privately, sources say the environment has changed noticeably across the company, with a clear focus on cost-cutting. </li><li>And Amazon isn’t alone.

Yes, there were respectable amenities, like big cafeterias and workout centers. But employees weren’t getting massages, napping in pods, or swilling Kombucha on tap. </li><li>Then Silicon Valley came along and changed the paradigm. The can-do, entrepreneurial vibe was matched with enviable perks that helped make a job in tech the decade’s hottest LinkedIn accessory. </li></ul><p><strong>Now, industry leaders are left to grapple with the beast they created. </strong>And it’s somehow a surprise to them that after decades of insane perks, employees are <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/anti-perks-benefits-corporate-culture" target="_self">pushing back</a> on efforts to curtail those benefits. </p><ul><li>“‘We shouldn’t always equate fun with money,” Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-infamously told employees</a>.

It’s officially spooky season.</em></p><p><em>This week in the startup world: VCs rethink the office, inside the Twitter deal-making, and Cloudflare tries to woo startups.</em></p><h3>VCs rethink where — and what — their office spaces are </h3><br/><p>In the pre-pandemic times, Contrary’s network of venture scouts, founders, and top technologists reflected the magnetic pull Silicon Valley had on the tech industry. About 80% were based in the Bay Area, with a smattering living elsewhere. Today, when Contrary asked where people in its network were living, the split had changed with 40% in the Bay Area and another 40% living in or planning to move to New York.</p><p>It’s totally bifurcated now, said Contrary’s founder Eric Tarczynski. “That was a big wake-up call for us. Before the pandemic, New York wasn’t even really on the road map,” Tarczynski said. “A huge cross-section of engineers are now in New York.”</p><p><strong>Sand Hill Road is losing its shine as more VCs rethink where they’re located. </strong>That’s not to say the Bay Area is over (I’d argue far from it). But cities like New York are still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/09/every-firm-is-talking-about-it-venture-capital-is-having-its-new-york-moment/?sh=5f6b0e487fa3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“having their moment”</a> and continue to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2022-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grow in share of venture deals</a> over the Bay Area. </p><ul><li>In the last year, venture firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed have added offices in New York City. </li><li>Check-writing partners for Greylock and Threshold VC moved to NYC, while other firms have stealthily set up shop with small teams working out of WeWorks. Even the reporters covering Silicon Valley <a href="https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1574490494918443042" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are moving to NYC</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>There’s another strategy change afoot. </strong>More venture firms are experimenting with building community spaces instead of more offices for their partners to work out of. </p><ul><li>In New York, Tarczynski’s venture firm built Contrary NYC, a space that’s meant to be like <a href="https://www.protocol.com/contrary-nyc-founder-space" target="_self">a Soho House for techies</a> (minus the pool, restaurants, and hotel rooms). It’s supposed to evoke the feel of a club where engineers and entrepreneurs can hang out together, have a space to work, and host events for people in tech. In the last few weeks, there have been female founder dinners, comedy shows, and an appearance by Serena Williams at a launch party for startup Parfait held at Contrary NYC. </li><li>In Los Angeles, Brianne Kimmel’s Worklife fund opened up its new <a href="https://www.worklife.vc/studios/silverlake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worklife Studios</a> space in the Silver Lake neighborhood. She advertises the space as a location where “Discords and DAOs can host events, remote workers can meet new people, and anyone can enjoy our eclectic schedule of gatherings — from dinner parties with the neighborhood to album listening parties with artists.” This past weekend, a thousand people <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1573382493616877569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were waiting in line</a> to get into its space: The band Wallows was doing a pop-up merch store.</li></ul><strong>Part of it is finding a tribe outside of Silicon Valley. </strong>In SF, it can be frustratingly homogenous with many people working in and around the tech industry. In NY and LA, there’s more diversity and with that more opportunity for VCs to step in and be that beacon for the tech communities in a way that’s not as needed in a market like the Bay Area. “For the past 20 or 30 years, SF was the only game in town,” Tarczynski said. “Having a little bit more distribution and even talent flow is frankly pretty good for the venture community.”<h3>Overheard</h3><br/><p><strong>“This makes it seem like I’m desperate. Please stop,” </strong>Elon Musk texted angel investor Jason Calacanis over his promotion of an SPV to buy Twitter shares. Court filings filled with Elon Musk’s texts this week showed the fascinating network of relationships and power brokers that surround Musk in this deal — and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players" style="" target="_self">the things that they’re angling for</a>. Steve Jurvetson suggested Emil Michael for the job of CEO, but Musk shot it down in favor of someone with actual software experience. Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman both signed off to invest billions via text. Calacanis had the most interesting relationship with Musk, sending off ideas about charging people, forcing employees back to the office, and even throwing his name in the ring for CEO. Musk asked if he wanted to be an adviser, and Calacanis replied “Board member, advisor, whatever.” “[Y]ou have my sword.” That tone changed later on when Musk appeared miffed at Calacanis after Morgan Stanley and Musk employee Jared Birchall were “very upset” with the way Calacanis was running the deal and that he was taking advantage of his friendship with Musk. “Only ever want to support you,” Calacanis replied <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">in the texts</a>. </p><p><strong></strong><strong>“Some of the business practices don’t rise to the level of ethics that we’re all used to in private equity with your investors and your customers and your community, and that has been a bit disappointing,”</strong> said Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo in a rebuke of the crypto industry. After buying shares in FTX and a handful of other crypto companies, the private equity billionaire <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c5dd6c35-d3e2-4602-a8e4-54266990cfd3?tpcc=nltermsheet" target="_blank">told the FT</a> that he’s backing off investing in the crypto market for now despite remaining long-term bullish on the sector.</p><strong>“When my friend asks if I want to invest, of course I’m going to kick in $10,000 — it’s a way to stay connected, an excuse to get updates,” </strong>an anonymous startup founder <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/silicon-valley-turns-angel-investing-into-a-social-currency" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a>.

Gavin Newsom signed into law a <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20212022/SB1008/" target="_blank">bill</a> that makes phone calls from California’s prisons free of charge. The new law places the cost of calls not on incarcerated people — or the people receiving calls from them — but on the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p><p>California is the second state after Connecticut and the biggest state by far to institute such a law, which is a direct shot at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-cost-prison-communications-driving-debt-racial-wealth-gap-2021-6" target="_blank">$1.4 billion prison telecom industry</a>. For years prison telecom companies have maintained rates that “can be unjustly and unreasonably high, thereby impeding the ability of inmates and their loved ones to maintain vital connections,” the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-takes-next-big-steps-reducing-inmate-calling-rates" target="_blank">said</a> in 2020. </p><p>Prison reform advocates argue the new California law will have a hugely positive impact on the families of incarcerated people in California — and potentially other states that follow California's lead.  <span></span></p><hr/><p>"From a public policy perspective,  we should be wanting people to stay connected to their social networks, to their families, to be able to start looking for employment if they are close to getting out," said state Sen. Josh Becker, who sponsored the bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1008" target="_blank">SB 1008</a>. "But we have a very perverse system, which inhibits that and actually throws many families into debt."</p><p>For years, the high cost of prison phone calls has sapped money from low-income families with incarcerated loved ones. According to <a href="https://ellabakercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-Pays-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 report</a> by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, 34% of families go into debt in their attempt to maintain contact with loved ones inside through phone calls and visitations. The impact is disproportionately felt by women of color, because of the corresponding disproportionate number of men of color in America’s prisons.</p><p>Now, with the governor's blessing, "the simple cost of a call is never going to impair their ability to tell their children they love them or help their partner problem-solve a parenting situation,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a prison reform organization, which was a key player in advocating for the bill.</p><p>The new law covers the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2022/09/Tpop1d220928.pdf" target="_blank">93,000 incarcerated people</a> in the state's prison system, and Becker hopes future legislation will extend free calls into California's city and county jails, as well.</p><p>In addition to making calls free to users, the law prohibits local agencies from “receiving revenue for the provision of communication services to persons in its custody." The law also charges the state’s utility commission with ensuring service does not fall below standard, now that calls are free. Proponents of the law say the policy change will cost California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-23/prison-jail-communication-california-senate-bill-1008" target="_blank">about $12 million annually</a>, but that is a small fraction of the <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4517" target="_blank">$14.2 billion budget for the state’s corrections department</a>.</p><p>In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has tried to clamp down on the astronomical costs charged by prison telecom providers including slashing fees and capping rates at 21 cents per minute for interstate calls in 2013. More recently, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-improved-communications-access-incarcerated-people" target="_blank">adopted</a> a rule to prevent prison phone companies from seizing pre-paid funds from users, after one prison telecom giant, GTL, was found to have <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/fcc-gtl" target="_blank">seized</a> $121 million in customer funds. Other local governments have notched their own victories in the fight against sky-high prison call rates. In 2019, New York became the first major city jail system to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/connecticut-free-prison-phone-calls-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">make calls free</a>. In 2020, San Francisco also made phone calls from its jails free and <a href="https://sfgov.org/financialjustice/newsletters/san-francisco-announces-all-phone-calls-county-jails-are-now-free" target="_blank">announced a policy change</a> that would "permanently stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families through phone calls."</p><p>But advocates are hopeful that California's law will set an example for other state governments, because of the sheer size of its prison population. “California has a much bigger system,  and what it does matters to the rest of the corrections community,” Tylek said. “It will be a huge trendsetter for everyone else.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Great products come from strong patents https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/great-products-are-built-on-strong-patents Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000

</p><p>In today’s knowledge-based economy, IP rights play a foundational role. “Core R&D is the first step in getting good products into people’s hands,” said John Smee, senior VP of engineering and global head of wireless research at Qualcomm.<em> “</em>Everything from smartphones to the Internet of Things, automotive and industrial innovation begins as a breakthrough within our research labs.” At Qualcomm, Smee said, strong IP laws help the company confidently conduct cutting-edge 5G and 6G wireless research that will make its way into products ranging from everyday consumer goods to the factory floor. </p><p>Semiconductor companies, in particular, are fiercely protective of their IP because it’s their primary competitive advantage. Chip companies go to extraordinary lengths to protect their IP by maintaining black boxes only accessible to one person per fab, choosing highly secure operating locations, and keeping R&D teams separate from fab operations teams.</p><p>On the legal side, America’s Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 bestows legal protection of chip topography and design layout IP while the EU’s Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products of 1986 protects IC design. These regulations “have encouraged firms to continue to innovate,” according to the findings of Qualcomm’s and Accenture’s report, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6108671984&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harnessing the power of the semiconductor value chain</a>.Having a high-quality patent portfolio also helps companies build out their ecosystem, should they choose to license, through advising, training, support for launches, assistance in expanding to new markets, and much more.</p><p>Licensing democratizes innovation and invention— it makes the cutting-edge IP developed by one firm accessible to a broad range of others. As such, it allows other companies to skip the R&D step and jump right into building on the innovator’s foundation. This lowers the barrier to entry for upstart companies while providing a steady return on investments for the companies who have the resources to dedicate to heavy R&D.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><strong>An outsize economic impact</strong></p><p>IP protection also has an outsized impact on the US economy and helps create good higher-paying jobs. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105345571&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A report from The United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) found that in 2019 industries that intensively use IP protection account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (or about $7.8 trillion) and employ one-third of the total workforce — that’s 47.2 million jobs. In 2019, the average weekly earnings of $1,517 for workers across all IP-intensive industries was 60% higher than weekly earnings for workers in other industries.</p><p>Workers in IP-intensive industries were more likely to earn higher wages as well as participate in employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement plans, the USPTO report found.</p><p> But patent laws are often subject to much debate — one person’s idea of protection is another’s view of monopoly. That’s where organizations like <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105346519&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeadershIP</a> come into play. The group brings together experts on IP and innovation to debate issues at the intersection of research, policy, and industry.</p><p>In addition, several efforts are underway to help inventors get their ideas into the marketplace. The Inventors Patent Academy (TIPA), for instance, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent. TIPA has designed its program to make patenting more accessible and understandable for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQIA, lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Closing these gaps would promote U.S. job creation, entrepreneurial activity, economic growth, and global leadership in innovation. Estimates suggest that increasing participation by underrepresented groups in invention and patenting would quadruple the number of American inventors and increase the annual U.S. gross domestic product <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6106154609&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">by nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>If we want our nation’s rich history of innovation to continue, experts say, we must create an IP protection ecosystem that helps ensure that tech innovation will thrive.</p><p>“With the protection of patents,” Smee said, “there is no limit to where our creativity can take us.”</p>

<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/titus-welliver-as-harry-bosch-in-freevee-s-bosch-legacy-holding-a-flashlight.jpg?id=31860744&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C36%2C0%2C371"/><br/><br/><p>Amazon’s streaming efforts have long been all about Prime Video. So the company caught pundits by surprise when, in early 2019, it launched a stand-alone ad-supported streaming service called IMDb Freedive, with Techcrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/amazons-imdb-launches-a-free-streaming-service-freedive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calling the move</a> “a bit odd.”</p><p>Nearly four years and two rebrandings later, Amazon’s ad-supported video efforts appear to be flourishing. Viewership of the service <a href="https://videoweek.com/2021/09/23/imdb-tv-is-quietly-becoming-an-avod-juggernaut/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew by 138%</a> from 2020 to 2021, according to Amazon. The company declined to share any updated performance data on the service, which is now called Freevee, but a spokesperson told Protocol the performance of originals in particular “exceeded expectations,” leading Amazon to increase investments into original content by 70% year-over-year.</p><p>Key to Freevee’s success has been its deep integration with Prime Video and Fire TV, where it lives alongside ad-free subscription fare, pay-as-you-go rentals, and third-party subscription channels. Now Amazon is looking to broaden its international reach.</p><p>“I'm very excited about the possibility of an ad-supported service in front of the paywall in many countries,” said Ryan Pirozzi, who has been working on Amazon’s video strategy for over a decade and became head of Freevee in August.</p><h3>IMDb TV was not standing out</h3><p>When Amazon first launched its free video service, it was looking to capitalize on the IMDb brand it has owned since 1998. “Our early thinking was, people recognize that brand,” said Pirozzi. However, the branding didn’t exactly catch on with consumers, in part because IMDb was best known as a database for industry professionals. </p><p>Changing the service’s name to IMDb TV did little to solve those issues, which is why the company ultimately switched to the Freevee brand in April of this year. “IMDb TV wasn’t standing out as much as Freevee is,” Pirozzi said. “Personally, I’m very happy we rebranded.”</p><p>Third-party data suggests the rebrand is working: The service’s mobile apps generated about as many downloads since the rebrand as it did during the years preceding it, according to estimates by app intelligence company Sensor Tower. For the five months following the rebrand, downloads were up 113% compared to the preceding five months.</p><p>The total number of installs of the Freevee mobile app is still fairly small, with Sensor Tower estimating the app  has been downloaded 3.3 million times from Google Play and the App Store, while Google’s own data puts the number of downloads from Google Play between 5 and 10 million.</p><p>The service is closely integrated with Prime Video, where its movies and shows are being presented as “free with ads.” Mixing subscription-exclusive content with free, ad-supported videos <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/smart-tvs-content-first" target="_self">can be confusing to consumers</a>, but Pirozzi argued that it was a trade-off for being able to offer more choices, which also includes access to pay-as-you-go movie rentals. </p><p>“We have to work on eliminating any confusion,” he said, adding that Freevee was growing both as a stand-alone service and within Prime Video. “I think people are getting it. Our best SVOD customers are our best TVOD customers [and are also] our most engaged AVOD customers.”<br/></p><h3>Uncertain times for streaming</h3><p>The ascent of Freevee happens as the entire streaming industry is rediscovering free, ad-supported video. Fox has plans to turn its free Tubi streaming service into a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/tubi-will-become-a-billion-dollar-business-foxs-lachlan-murdoch-says" target="_blank">billion-dollar business</a>; Viacom’s Pluto TV reached that same milestone <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/" target="_blank">a year ago</a>. Even Netflix, which long resisted advertising, is <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-microsoft-ads-partners" target="_self">getting ready to launch an ad-supported tier</a>. </p><p>At the same time, there are some signs that parts of the industry are slowing their investments into originals in light of a more challenging economic climate. Warner Bros. Discovery, for instance, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-strategy?rebelltitem=1" target="_self">canceled several projects for HBO Max recently</a>. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image image-crop-16x9">

</p><p>“I guess I must have missed the memo,” Pirozzi retorted, pointing to the fact that Freevee’s investments into originals have increased by 70%. Some of the originals running in the service include “Bosch: Legacy,” a spin-off of the police procedural “Bosch” that ran on Prime Video for seven seasons; “Judy Justice,” a remake of “Judge Judy”; and ex-con comedy “Sprung.”</p><p>These shows may not pay for themselves, but they do work to attract new audiences. “Originals and pay-window movies are a customer acquisition driver,” Pirozzi said. “Then we drive depth of engagement with licensed content, deeper catalog, and linear channels. That model has been working for us, and we see big uplifts in our business when we launch something like a ‘Bosch: Legacy.’”</p><p>Many of these originals are also being repurposed for linear free ad-supported streaming channels, also <a href="https://www.protocol.com/plex-live-tv-linear-streaming" target="_self">known as FAST channels among industry insiders</a>. “This rise of FAST linear channels is so fascinating,” Pirozzi said. “To some people, it’s sort of retro. It’s in a linear format without pause or fast forward. But that’s really growing and working for us.”</p><p>Freevee’s more than 100 free linear channels are closely integrated with Amazon’s Fire TV platform, where they are presented as part of the live TV tab. The linear format also allows Amazon to carry some content that it would otherwise not have the rights to, Pirozzi explained. “‘Kim’s Convenience,’ one of my favorite shows on Netflix, is not available to license on demand,” he said. However, Amazon was able to license the show as a linear channel, which it now streams to Freevee viewers.<br/>Freevee debuted in Germany in August after expanding to the U.K. last year. Now, the service is looking to jump into new territories.</p><p>“We have greater international expansion plans,” Pirozzi said. He declined to share Amazon’s exact road map, but suggested that there may be opportunities in Latin America, Southern Europe, and Asia, among others.<br/></p><p>“There are so many places where the value proposition of an ad-supported video product will be very popular with customers,” he said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Biden’s AI Bill of Rights shoots for the stars.

Today we look at the AI Bill of Rights from the White House and how it fits into the existing privacy push by Congress. As you have likely already heard, the Twitter deal is back on. Also, Micron plans to invest a whopping $100 billion in a New York state chip factory thanks to the Chips-Plus package.</em></p><h3>Pie in the sk(AI)</h3><br/><p>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday unveiled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf" target="_blank">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a>. The document is lofty and well intended, but not particularly practical in the near term — nor to the liking of some AI watchdogs, as Protocol’s Kate Kaye <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights" target="_self">pointed out</a>.</p><ul><li>The white paper sketches out five standards that will help ensure automated systems don’t infringe on our rights: protection from unsafe systems, equitable/nondiscriminatory algorithms, agency over our data, transparency over automated systems, and access to opt-outs and remedies. </li><li>(Sorry, if you were expecting a <a href="https://twitter.com/cfiesler/status/1577367260510924802?s=20&t=QfFlXeQ5cbsQuosM0y4wog" target="_blank">manifesto on the rights of sentient robots</a>, look elsewhere.) </li></ul><p><strong>The OSTP is careful to emphasize that it’s only intended to support the development of official policies.</strong> In other words, the AI Bill of Rights has as much legal authority as this newsletter. Still, it’s useful in that it represents a sort of regulatory wish list for the Biden administration. </p><ul><li>To be fair, the OSTP includes a lot of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-enterprise/white-house-ai-samsung-chips?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">precise, prescriptive guidance</a> for corporations. The infeasibility doesn’t come from the lack of specific guidance, then, but from the fact that corporations are unlikely to respond unless compelled by the government. </li><li>Some of the guidance is also so disruptive to the status quo that it would remake entire industries. For example, the AI Bill of Rights advises that “you should be able to opt out from automated systems in favor of a human alternative.” But there simply <em>aren’t</em> human alternatives at scale for much of what we do on the internet.</li></ul><p><strong>Sometimes the OSTP doesn’t even seem sure of its own recommendations.</strong> For example, the bill of rights calls for unchecked surveillance to be avoided unless “strictly necessary” but then goes on to say national security agencies should only abide by these guidelines “where feasible.” So, you know … restaurants should never charge extra for guac, but Chipotle can do so “when convenient.” </p><p><strong>These feasibility challenges persist in the prescriptions for the private sector.</strong> </p><ul><li>The OSTP calls for the timely removal of user data from machine learning systems trained with that data. But as I’ve <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/pipelines-data-privacy-design" target="_self">noted before</a>, companies often have no idea where user data flows within their own data pipelines. This complexity likely makes it impossible to comply with existing privacy laws, including the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a>. </li><li>The OSTP also tells companies they should be doing “proactive equity assessments” while also not tracking or using proxies for demographic features. How do you verify lack of bias against a demographic while also ensuring you can’t track it? </li></ul><p><strong>The bill of rights goes above and beyond the primary federal bill under consideration — and that may be its greatest strength. </strong>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8152/text#H88DA5D95E892448B9DDA6F37E0106E77" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a> is a <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/privacy-draft-2022" target="_self">big deal</a>, even if it suffers from a significant <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/privacy-preemption-adppa?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">preemption problem</a>. But next to the AI Bill of Rights, it looks somewhat unambitious: </p><ul><li>There’s overlap in the sense that both the ADPPA and the AI Bill of Rights say Americans should be able to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/federal-privacy-law-introduced?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10" target="_self">request</a> their information, request that it be deleted, and tell companies to change personal information when it’s not accurate.</li><li>But the bill of rights <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/#privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">includes</a> many more ambitious privacy goals, including more rigorous consent standards for obtaining user data and better data protections in sensitive user domains such as health care and education. </li><li>The ambiguity and idealism in the AI Bill of Rights can be criticized as its greatest weakness, but in some sense they are its greatest strength: The document shows the federal government is at least thinking of privacy in a much more ambitious way than the bills in Congress would let on. </li></ul><p>The OSTP shot for the stars. Congress is still on the ground building a privacy foundation. That combination in itself can be a great thing. But if ADPPA ends up not passing, what use do we have for a starry-eyed bill of rights? </p><em>— Hirsh Chitkara (</em><a href="mailto:hchitkara@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/hirshchitkara" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em><h3>In Washington</h3><br/><p><strong>The Twitter <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">deal</a></strong><strong> is back on … probably.</strong> Elon Musk on Tuesday sent a letter to Twitter saying he’d buy the company at his original offered price of $54.20 per share.

One area that’s being built out is crypto trading as a service, with APIs and other products that developers and companies can use to set up crypto trading for their clients. </p><p>The latest sign of this maturation is EDX Markets, a new exchange for digital assets that’s being developed by Wall Street players like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab, as well as venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm.</p><p>The digital exchange, headed by former Citadel Securities executive Jamil Nazarali, is roughly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/13/charles-schwab-citadel-fidelity-and-others-start-crypto-exchange-edx-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">modeled</a> on and built on the trading technology of Members Exchange, or MEMX, another exchange that’s being developed by similar companies as an alternative to large stock exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq.</p><p>EDXM’s custody and wallet technology is being provided by crypto custody and infrastructure company Paxos, the companies announced Wednesday</p><p>Paxos, which is a custodian regulated by New York state, holds customer accounts in fully segregated accounts and has signed up large consumer-facing clients to enable crypto trading. Its customers include PayPal, broker dealers such as Interactive Brokers, and others such as Nubank and Mastercard. Paxos has a conditional bank trust charter from the <a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-49.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OCC</a> and says it expects its chartered entity, Paxos National Trust, to open later this quarter.</p><p>Up until now big banks haven’t moved heavily into crypto because of accounting, risk, security, and regulatory concerns, as well as requirements by the Federal Reserve and a desire for more mature technology, said Walter Hessert, head of strategy at Paxos. “We still haven't seen any of the big bank holding companies in the U.S. bring one of these offerings to market,” he added.</p><p>EDXM, with its leadership and backing from Wall Street firms, could attract large banks into digital assets, he said. EDXM is “bringing traditional market structure and also traditional market participants to this liquidity offering through the exchange that is going to be really built to support and attract these types of bank holding companies and brokerages,” Hessert said. For example, EDXM plans to offer delivery settlement versus payment <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/172104/edx-markets-ceo-vows-to-learn-from-travails-at-rival-institutional-crypto-exchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settlement</a>, a settlement method that’s used in traditional securities trading. </p><p>EDXM is also different from some other crypto providers that are the market maker, exchange, and custodian all in one, which can be a conflict of interest and is typically not done in traditional markets, Hessert said.</p><p>More large liquidity pools such as EDXM will also increase transparency for the crypto market, Hessert said. Presently, crypto markets can be opaque, with large spreads and high volatility.</p><p>The competition to provide crypto trading, custody, security, and related technology for large institutions is intense. The resulting consolidation wave isn’t without some hiccups: Wyre canceled its <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/bolt-axes-15b-deal-to-buy-crypto-infrastructure-provider-wyre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deal</a> to be acquired by Bolt for $1.5 billion last month. But more deals could soon come in this sector, since numerous providers offer overlapping services, analysts say. </p><p>Coinbase provides crypto trading APIs, custody, payments API, and related services, seeking to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/coinbase-cloud-node" target="_self">lure big and small</a> customers alike. Coinbase has three related APIs — a general-purpose one for trading, deposits, withdrawals, and tax reporting; another for streaming market data; and a specialized FIX API for sophisticated traders. Coinbase, which recently announced a deal with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/04/blackrock-to-offer-crypto-for-institutional-investors-through-coinbase-prime/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, has an advantage in routing orders to its own exchange or, for large customers using its Prime API, to other liquidity providers. </p><p>A number of other API providers like Prime Trust, MoonPay, Wyre, and Transak have emerged to offer quick and easy connections to crypto trading and other services, particularly for fintech and crypto developers building apps. Custody providers such as Anchorage and Fireblocks also offer crypto trading.

Too bad. https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/apple-app-store-price-hike Wed, 05 Oct 2022 11:15:09 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/apple-s-planned-price-hike-is-going-into-effect.png?id=31864079&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><strong>Good morning! </strong>Apple hiked App Store prices by around 20% in some markets outside the U.S. without any explanation and with barely any notice. Critics are unsurprisingly upset, but what choice do they have?</p><h3>It’s Apple’s party, and it’ll charge if it wants to</h3><br/><p>The App Store just became a little pricier for many non-U.S. customers. Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e1b1hcmv&1663640181" target="_blank">planned price hike</a> went into effect today for any market that uses the euro, in addition to Chile, Egypt, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, South Korea, Sweden, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In most markets, the price increase equates to about 20% higher costs for apps (though it’s even more in some countries, like Japan and South Korea). So a mobile app that was previously 0.99 euros now costs 1.19 euros, while the same is true for an in-app purchase like mobile game currency. Curiously, Apple isn’t saying why exactly, leaving developers to guess whether it’s due to currency fluctuations, the related global economic crisis, or perhaps rising energy costs related to operating the App Store overseas. </p>
<p><strong>The price hike is arriving at a sensitive time. </strong>The combination of record inflation and a looming global recession has started to take a serious toll on foreign markets as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/16/business/strong-dollar.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strength of the U.S. dollar continues to grow</a> relative to weakening foreign currencies like the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. </p><ul><li>While Apple has yet to raise prices in the U.S., it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/apple-raises-iphone-14-price-in-uk-japan-australia-overseas-markets.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hiked the price</a> of the new iPhone 14 lineup in Australia, Germany, Japan, and the U.K., in some cases by the equivalent of nearly $150. </li><li>A number of other consumer electronics companies, including PlayStation maker Sony, have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enacted similar hardware price hikes</a> in the EU and other markets in recent months. </li><li>Apple can certainly afford to weather any economic storms better than most, if not all, of its competitors. In its last earnings announcement from July, Apple said it had a record Q3 with $19.6 billion in services revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase. </li><li>The company remains the most valuable in the world with a market cap of more than $2.3 trillion. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple critics are not pleased. </strong>Naturally, a price hike with little explanation and on such short notice is going to rankle Apple's usual detractors in the developer community, including Fortnite maker Epic Games. But the criticisms have grown especially pointed given the current economic climate. </p><ul><li>“These increases were made without the input or consent of app developers, which highlights the extent of Apple’s market power. In no other industry can a business single-handedly increase the prices of another business’s products,” <a href="https://appfairness.org/coalition-for-app-fairness-blog-on-apple-price-increases/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Rick VanMeter, the executive director for the nonprofit Coalition for App Fairness, of which Epic, Match Group, and Spotify are members. </li><li>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had harsh words, too. “Imagine if a landlord told their small business tenant they had to increase their prices without any say in the matter or anywhere else to go,” he said in a statement yesterday. “That is what Apple is doing to developers for no other reason than to pad Apple’s bottom line.”</li><li>“Developers don't want to raise their app prices in the EU and UK. Consumers don't want app price increases in the EU and UK. Central banks fighting inflation don't want app price inflation,” Sweeney wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1577032444955746304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">follow-up tweet yesterday</a>. “But Apple is raising developers' prices against developers' wishes.” </li></ul>
<p><strong>Apple is no stranger to sudden price increases. </strong>For decades, the iPhone maker has exercised near-total control of its software ecosystems, including the digital storefronts it has operated since the days of iTunes. </p>
<ul><li>You might remember when Apple infamously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/07/apple-begins-variable-pricing-on-itunes-store-some-songs-now-129-each/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised the price</a> of newer, more popular MP3s on the iTunes Store from 99 cents to $1.29. The move, a concession to the music industry, helped <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/02/09/itunes_price_increases_mean_slower_sales_for_music_labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labels sell more albums</a> after years of complaints that the era of iTunes pushed consumers toward buying singles over albums. There was plenty of hand-wringing at the time, but nothing really changed. That is, until music streaming took off and individual song sales began to decline. </li></ul>
<p>But there is no comparable distribution change for mobile apps or the App Store on the horizon. Apple sets the rules for commerce on iOS, and everyone must follow — so long as they want to reach iPhone customers.<br/><br/><em>— Nick Statt</em><br/></p><h3>The Twitter drama has only just begun</h3><br><p>Elon Musk decided, seemingly out of nowhere, that he actually <em>will</em> buy Twitter. But before you assume the roller coaster ride is over, think again.</p>
<p><strong>Musk <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal" target="_self">sent a letter</a> to Twitter </strong>proposing to buy the company at the original, agreed-upon price of $54.20 a share provided the company agrees to forget the whole court battle. Twitter shares jumped on the news before exchanges halted trading.</p>
<ul><li>The news coincidentally broke at the same time Twitter employees were entering a long meeting about its 2023 strategy. Very funny, we know.</li><li>Twitter said it received Musk’s letter and intends to close the deal at the original price. It hasn’t addressed Musk’s proposal to end its lawsuit.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk and Twitter could be entering even muddier waters, </strong>where the company will transition to a whole new owner who has expressed rather controversial ideas about the service. What happens next could go like this, as described by Protocol Policy editor Kate Cox:</p><ul><li>Step one: Musk buys Twitter!</li><li>Step two: ???</li><li>Step three: Twitter reaches profitability under Musk.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Musk loves to prove the skeptics wrong, </strong>and turning Twitter around could be another way to do it. But those question marks are there for a reason: the details of how he would do it are beyond murky. </p><ul><li>How will Twitter employees — the ones who haven’t fled the company in droves as the acquisition moil unfolded, that is — react? </li><li>How will he handle the spam problem he cited as an excuse to walk away from the deal?</li><li>Musk offered one cryptic hint about his plans in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>: “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-elon-musk-buys-his-old-x-com-domain-from-paypal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reclaimed</a> the X.com domain from PayPal in 2017, and has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1557199404301307904" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">teased</a> the idea of building a Twitter competitor on it.</li></ul>There are also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-04/twitter-lbo-revives-12-5-billion-headache-for-wall-street-banks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">questions about the debt financing</a> needed to close the deal, and Musk and Twitter will have to thrash out what to do about the pending lawsuit. But if they can overcome those obstacles, Twitter will get a new owner and a different future. The one true thing we can say about both: They are completely unpredictable.<br/><br/><p><em>— Sarah Roach</em></p><h3>​The calm before the storm</h3><br><p>Hundreds of companies that cut staff in recent months announced major funding rounds just a few months before. But startups aren’t blowing through their funding weeks after the check is deposited; it’s <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/layoffs-funding-data" target="_self">more complicated than that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Startups often wait several months to a year </strong>after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public about it.</p><ul><li>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners, told Nat. </li><li>This is because founders often want to announce funding with other big news, like a product release or an executive hire. </li></ul>
<p><strong>The bigger an organization gets, </strong>the more secretive it becomes about funding updates. News of a big check is easier to keep from leaking publicly at a company of 100 compared to a company of 2,000, Alban said. </p><ul><li>Companies like Bolt, Getir, and Trade Republic caught flack for this very reason. Many employees said they felt betrayed, as funding announcements gave the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. </li><li>“Bolt employees were blind sided because the CEO was saying just weeks ago how everything is fine,” <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Bolt-just-layed-off-people-in-the-worst-way-possible-yL7QauTE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an anonymous user wrote on the message board Blind</a>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>To help ease the blow of layoffs, </strong>being transparent can go a long way. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Anthony Kline, a partner at VC firm The GP.<br/><br/><em>— Nat Rubio-Licht</em><br/></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM CAPITAL ONE SOFTWARE</h3><br><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="0b87547b908f01341fe8a968efb24080" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123932305&iu=/21901267728" id="b689f" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843120&width=980"/></a>Many business leaders aren’t sure where to begin when it comes to migrating to the cloud.

The legislation allowed some families to <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/taxact/file-for-less-and-get-more/understanding-the-expanded-child-tax-credit-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly double</a> their tax benefits per child, which was especially critical for low-income families, who disproportionately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/04/20/covid-19-pandemic-pinches-finances-of-americas-lower-and-middle-income-families/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bore the financial brunt</a> of the pandemic. </p><p>For Amanda Renteria, the <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/safety-net-innovation-lab-audacious-ted-talk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CEO of Code for America</a>, the new legislation meant the work had only just begun. Renteria understood that making tax credits available is one thing, but helping families navigate bureaucracy to get them is another. Renteria also knew that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Code for America</a>, a nonprofit that helps the government use technology to better serve communities, could play a critical role in addressing that access problem. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Renteria explained how she made the decision to develop a proof of concept for an app that would help people claim the Child Tax Credit. Code for America developed this mock-up despite limited resources and no guarantee that it would be selected by the government as its technology partner. The leap of faith ended up paying off, and Code for America reported in May that it <a href="https://codeforamerica.org/news/code-for-america-getctc-portal-returns-for-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped</a> 115,000 families successfully claim the tax benefit throughout the 2021 tax filing season. </p><p><em>Renteria’s story, as told to Protocol, has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What we knew about the IRS, having worked with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program [last year], is just how hard it is for people to get through [the system to get benefits].</strong> With VITA, we helped create an online, mobile-friendly, simplified application that actually walks you through [the process] in both English and Spanish. </p><p><strong>When Child Tax Credit came up, we knew that this policy — though it passed and everyone was excited about it — would actually hit a wall. </strong>We had seen the barriers over time on much easier processes, like food assistance in some states. </p><p><strong>We knew filling out forms is extremely difficult.</strong> So there wasn't even a question of whether or not we could make this process better. Again, [this was] largely because we had been doing it for a while. We helped VITA sites go online the year before, and we could actually see how you improve throughput if you have a simplified process.</p><p><strong>The big question for us was whether we wanted to build it, knowing we weren't sure whether it would land. </strong>A lot of the question was how we bring the White House, the Treasury, and the IRS up to speed with our lessons learned. We are a small nonprofit. There were no guarantees that anyone would believe us — trust not only our data, but our ability to do it. </p><p><strong>We felt our need to jump in because we didn’t see it happening anywhere else. </strong>During that period of time, we were still in transition to a new administration, so we knew that the federal government was still building up its digital talent. The private sector was also focused on higher-end clients and how they were going to live in a new online world. Everything was changing during a pandemic, and the only way we were going to reach [families] was through their phones, and trying to be as simplified and trustworthy as possible.</p><p><strong>So in very short order, our engineering team put together a mock-up of what it would look like.</strong> [It showed] what the experience would be, how we would triage, how we would ensure that clients are being taken care of through chat. We were able to turn this around in a couple of weeks, but it was based on 10 years of research. We were really confident in our ability to create a front door that spoke to the clients we were trying to serve. We were less confident in whether or not it would be enough to show [the White House] what's possible.</p><p><strong>In a meeting with the White House and Treasury, we walked through the actual process someone would go through.</strong> Within that, not only did we build trust in terms of the relationship we already had, but the tangibility of seeing the vision of what was possible was a key difference for them. But that took some risk on our part — we had to build it before we knew whether it would actually be a relationship that could lead to the scale we have now proved to have.</p><p><div id="series-box"></div>

With the change, Parikh is now the sole chief executive of the privately held company, a prominent up-and-coming player in cloud security that last year achieved a valuation of $8.3 billion.</p><p>Lacework planned to inform employees of the change on Tuesday. Hatfield, who previously served as president at Pure Storage, leaves Lacework's executive leadership a few months shy of his second year with the company. </p><p>As part of the co-CEO model, Hatfield, who goes by the nickname "Hat," focused on business operations and expansion at Lacework, which has raised $1.85 billion in funding. Hatfield joined Lacework as CEO and chairman in early 2021. He could not immediately be reached Tuesday.</p><p>Parikh joined as co-CEO in <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-lacework-jay-parikh" target="_blank">mid-2021</a>, and has focused on product and engineering for the company. The two have known each other for two decades, having previously worked at the same time at Akamai Technologies.</p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Parikh characterized the move as planned and amicable, prompted by conversations between "Hat, myself, and the board" that led to the conclusion that the co-CEO model was no longer the best fit for the company. Lacework's executive leadership and board have been "looking at where the business is and what it needs to get to the next level," and have determined that "unifying the company" under a single CEO made the most sense right now, Parikh said.</p><p>When it comes to Lacework's product and sales strategy and its relationships with customers, partners, and the big public cloud platforms, the move should help with "making sure that's all unified [around] one set of priorities with one focus," he said.</p><p>Parikh said he doesn't believe Hatfield has "any immediate plan to go jump into anything full-time anytime soon." Hatfield is "still going to be spending a good amount of time" on Lacework, Parikh told Protocol.<br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25 rm-float-right" data-rm-resized-container="25%" style="float: right;">

</p><p>Founded in 2014, Lacework offers a "data-driven" service that aims to stand out in the fast-growing cloud security market by collecting and analyzing data from across a customer's cloud environments. The goal is to to provide customers with crucial security insights, such as which threats to prioritize for action, the company has said.</p><p>The company raised a $525 million funding round in January 2021, followed by an additional $1.3 billion in funding in November 2021 that brought with it the $8.3 billion valuation. Lacework touted that round as "the largest funding round in security industry history," and the company ranks at No. 3 in terms of the biggest valuations for privately held security companies, according to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies" target="_blank">CB Insights</a>.</p><p>Lacework is also notable for having been just the third company to be incubated out of Sutter Hill Ventures, following a model that was used to launch Pure Storage and Snowflake. The Lacework platform supports AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as Kubernetes environments. </p><p>In May, Lacework disclosed that it had laid off <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/lacework-layoffs-cloud-security-startup" target="_blank">20% of its staff</a>, in response to what the co-CEOs <a href="https://www.lacework.com/blog/lacework-update/" target="_blank">then described</a> as a "seismic shift" in "both the public and private markets." The company had previously <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/cybersecurity-has-53-unicorns-here-are-10-to-watch/" target="_blank">reported</a> having more than 1,000 employees as of March, and did not immediately have a figure available for its current employee count on Tuesday.</p><p>Prior to Lacework, Hatfield had previously spent nearly seven years as president at Pure Storage followed by 16 months as its vice chair, according to his LinkedIn. He joined the company as president in 2013, a few years into its founding, and stayed on through its initial public offering and its first several years as a public company.</p><p>While there are no plans to directly replace Hatfield at Lacework, given the unification of the CEO duties under Parikh's leadership, the company does plan to hire a chief revenue officer in the near future, Parikh said.</p><p>Ultimately, Lacework's leadership is focusing on making moves that will set it up "to be successful over 10, 20 years — we're not building this to be a transaction," Parikh said. <br/></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The future of pay transparency in tech https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/pay-transparency-in-tech-sb1162 Tue, 04 Oct 2022 22:07:11 +0000

We spoke with Susan Alban, operating partner and chief people officer at Renegade Partners, and compensation consultant Ashish Raina to learn how.</p><hr/><p><strong>Startups will adopt pay bands earlier.</strong> Five or 10 years ago, it wasn’t unusual for 50-person companies to be operating without a “career ladder” or “career architecture” with compensation bands for different job functions and levels, Alban said.</p><ul><li>Today’s tighter labor market — and demands from candidates — mean that companies structure their compensation bands sooner.</li><li>Because the new law applies to companies with just 15 employees, even tiny startups will be required to define their pay bands in a more structured way, Alban said.</li><li>“Which is a little funky when you have, like, eight people, to have a band for every single job, because sometimes you just have one person in a job,” she said. “It just nudges companies to be a little bit more thoughtful in defining what is the job, what is the relative seniority, and what would we reasonably pay relative to market-based pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>Companies may find other ways to differentiate pay in order to compete for the best talent. </strong>The law only requires companies to disclose base pay, not stock, bonuses, or benefits. </p><ul><li>This means bonuses and equity could become more important forms of compensation, which may shift the issue of unequal pay to other areas.</li><li>Bonuses “can be very arbitrary,” especially in early-stage companies where goals change all the time, Alban said.</li><li>They may prove to be even more important levers for attracting and retaining great employees, however. “Fair pay is not equal pay,” Raina said. “If someone is more proficient or more highly performing in a role, there should be a differentiation in pay.”</li></ul><p><strong>The law might provide a little more incentive for companies to hire outside of California, </strong>but not much. The law on its own is unlikely to have a major effect on where companies hire, but it adds more administrative headache to California employers.</p><ul><li>“I don’t hear employers talking about not wanting to hire in the state of Colorado because of these laws,” Alban said.</li><li>Some companies may choose to advertise jobs with a national labor rate that would overpay candidates in low-cost states like Mississippi but underpay Californians, Raina said.</li></ul><p><strong>Big companies are likely to comply more readily than startups.</strong> An online job search shows companies like Google, Salesforce, and Twitter listing pay ranges in ads. Some listings cite the Colorado law explicitly.</p><ul><li>“I think the general consensus among progressive technology employers is that this is the way the world is going,” Alban said. “Rather than fret about it and deviate from hiring in particular regions to avoid compliance, better to just comply anyway.”</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li>Some startups likely won’t comply with the law, Raina said. “They’re trying to survive,” he said. “Yes, this law exists, and yes, there’s going to be some risk if they don’t comply, but that isn’t necessarily people’s forefront of an issue.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The EU ushers in the USB-C era https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-apple-iphone-ewaste Tue, 04 Oct 2022 19:32:24 +0000

The mandate will extend to laptops in 2026. </p><p>The rule — which was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/eu-usbc-charging-ewaste" target="_blank">introduced in June</a> — passed 602-13, while eight members abstaining from voting. That reflects an overwhelming desire to make the average person's life easier (goodbye, cluttered junk drawer) as well as cut down on pernicious e-waste. While the decision means that ports such as micro-USB will fall by the wayside, Apple's Lightning port is also slated to go the way of the dinosaur. </p><p>The company's iPad and various MacBooks rely on USB-C charging. But Apple has held steadfastly to the technology for the iPhone, rolling out its most recent iteration of the phone with a Lightning rather than a USB-C port. The iPhone was the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/31/european-smartphone-market-2021/" target="_blank">bestselling phone</a> in the EU last year, with Apple capturing 34% of the smartphone market.</p><p>The European Council needs to sign off on the legislation before it officially goes into law. But that prospect looks likely. After that, the clock to USB-C hegemony begins counting down. The timing could work out well for Apple at least; the company releases a new iPhone every year in September. With the mandate likely to take effect in fall 2024, it means next year's iPhone could well be the last one to feature a Lightning port — unless Apple decides to just get the switch over with, something the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066661/apple-iphone-15-drop-lightning-port-usb-c-2023-prediction-rumor" target="_blank">company is reportedly considering</a>. </p><p>The company could also make a USB-C version of the iPhone for the EU and a Lightning version for everyone else, of course, but that seems unlikely given the logistical hurdles. The iPhone could also go totally portless for charging, though that would be a much more radical leap. <br/></p><p>As written, the rule would allow electronics without a USB-C port to continue being sold as long as they are "placed on the market before the date of application," according to a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220930IPR41928/long-awaited-common-charger-for-mobile-devices-will-be-a-reality-in-2024" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the vote. Regardless, if you're a Lightning stan, uh, you should consider snapping up an iPhone 14 sooner than later.</p><p>Cutting down on e-waste is a sneaky climate policy. The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Pages/Spotlight/Global-Ewaste-Monitor-2020.aspx" target="_blank">Global E-Waste Monitor</a> put out by the United Nations showed that nearly 54 million tons of e-waste piled up in 2020, a number that could rise to almost 75 million tons by the end of this decade. That's a local environmental concern given the toxic chemicals and components. But it's also a huge waste of emissions. More than two-thirds of the carbon pollution tied to electronics is emitted in the manufacturing process. </p><p>Cutting down on the number of charging cables produced (and trashed) is a relatively modest way to cut down on e-waste. Stronger policies that favor right-to-repair as well as companies working harder to stave off forced obsolescence could also offer a pathway to reduce the amount of electronic churn. Improving e-waste recycling is yet another avenue to cut down on trash; the Global E-Waste Monitor found only 17.4% of electronic trash is currently recycled. Apple and other tech companies have touted moving toward a circular economy as central to their sustainability goals. While the EU's USB-C mandate alone won't make that transition magically happen, it could spur further innovation and serve as a reminder of all the work that remains to be done.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Why $100 per ton is the carbon removal industry's holy grail https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-removal-cost-per-ton Tue, 04 Oct 2022 18:03:51 +0000

It’s one of <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/frontier-cdr-purchases-stripe-alphabet" target="_self">Frontier’s</a> stated criteria that the fund uses to evaluate its advance purchases. In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-scale-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of the long-duration carbon removal community, CarbonPlan found that stakeholders are focused on the $100 benchmark. The Department of Energy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/climate/glasgow-carbon-removal-climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even announced</a> that it would be investing in carbon removal research to bring the cost of the technology down to $100 per ton.</p><hr/><p><strong>Where did that number come from? </strong>In short, it’s the cost per ton of removal services that it would take for the CDR industry to reach commercial viability. It’s based on a handful of factors. </p><ul><li>It’s the point at which carbon removal becomes affordable at the scale needed to make it a meaningful tool to reach net zero (and, eventually, negative emissions), Shuchi Talati, a senior visiting scholar at Carbon180, told Protocol. </li><li>It evolved from modeling and policy conversations, and is aligned with other existing costs, like the European Union’s carbon price (which will likely reach that number in a decade). </li><li>It’s also tied to the social cost of carbon, a metric that measures the economic damage a ton of carbon emitted causes. Estimates of the social cost of carbon keep increasing as climate damages become clearer.</li><li>Another reason could be much simpler. The climate community could just be taking its cue from the DOE, anchoring its own targets to the agency’s <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Carbon Negative Shot target</a>, which was set for $100 per ton, CarbonPlan’s Danny Cullenward wrote in an email to Protocol.</li></ul><p><strong>So far, no one has come anywhere close to reaching that target. </strong>Currently, most carbon removal services cost well above $100 per ton, although the Inflation Reduction Act’s updated 45Q tax credit of up to $180 per ton for direct air capture could help some startups get closer to achieving that target. </p><p>“$100 per ton is an extremely ambitious 10-year target, likely probably more of a 15- to 20-year target,” Talati said. But she thinks it’s “important to be ambitious,” and “there’s a lot of momentum around CDR and getting these technologies to scale.”</p><p>The world could have to remove <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-dioxide-removal-needs" target="_self">billions of tons of carbon pollution</a> per year from the atmosphere by midcentury depending on how fast emissions fall in the interim.

Within hours, it had become clear that Stadia’s shutdown, planned for next January, would involve more than just refunding consumer purchases and quietly bowing out.</p><p>Now developers are scrambling to salvage planned projects, migrate players to other platforms, and figure out whether they’re still owed money from Google before the search giant puts Stadia out to pasture for good.</p><hr/><p><strong>Stadia’s shutdown came as a surprise.</strong> Scores of indie game makers, not typically bound by the conservative norms of corporate PR, took to Twitter to explain their frustrations upon learning of the shutdown from news articles and a terse <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">five-paragraph blog post</a> from Stadia chief Phil Harrison. </p><ul><li>“Tangle Tower was due to launch on Stadia in 2 days time, and this article was the first I heard about it shutting down,” SFB Games co-founder Tom Vian <a href="https://twitter.com/SFBTom/status/1575558078367690752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Thursday.</li><li>“We have a title coming out November 1st,” Rebecca Heineman, CEO of indie studio Olde Sküül, wrote in response to Vian. “Now we hear about this.” Olde Sküül has since <a href="https://twitter.com/OldeSkuul/status/1575863134857793536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it will release its planned Stadia game, Luxor Evolved, on console and PC in 2023. </li><li>“We have a game coming to Stadia in November.

The consensus: We’re looking into it. </p><ul><li>Ubisoft has been Google’s longest cloud gaming partner, having given the company Assassin’s Creed Origins to test Stadia’s Project Stream predecessor. And with 38 games on the platform, Ubisoft <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said on Friday</a> it was “working” to allow Stadia customers to bring those purchases to PC but had nothing more to share. </li><li>“We hear you - we are looking into ways for you to continue your HITMAN experience on other platforms,” <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Hitman developer IO Interactive. </li><li>“All I can say now is that we’re currently looking into the matter, and exploring possible options,” a representative of Cyberpunk 2077 studio CD Projekt Red <a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1576970793006747648" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told The Verge</a>. </li><li>“We just learned about Stadia shutting down and have begun conversations about next steps for our players,” a Bungie representative <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5Efe3ce7c2836c90e2787ce169a12fbfa6c976cdbd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fdestiny-2-and-hitman-developers-respond-to-google-stadia-shutdown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> to the company’s Destiny 2 forums. </li><li>One player of the online component of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 who logged more than 6,000 hours into the game for Twitch and YouTube content has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-onlines-biggest-superfan-may-lose-6000-hours-of-progress-on-stadia/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no idea if they can migrate their account</a> off of Stadia. Rockstar has yet to respond to Stadia’s shutdown. </li></ul><p><strong>It’s not clear why Google axed Stadia now,</strong> and why it did so with little to no warning for any of the various parties that invested time, money, and other resources into the platform over the last three years. </p><ul><li>Google is undergoing a serious cost-cutting effort at the moment to contend with the economic downturn. And Stadia was expensive: Last year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-26/google-video-game-unit-stadia-struggled-to-be-googley-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that Stadia spent tens of millions of dollars just to secure rights to a single big-budget release like Red Dead Redemption 2. </li><li>CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/google-ceo-says-he-hopes-to-make-company-20percent-more-efficient-hints-at-potential-cuts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> last month he wants to make the company “20% more productive,” and hiring slowdowns, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348999/google-pixelbook-canceled-team-shut-down" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cancellation of a new Pixelbook</a>, and other cost-cutting efforts may have pushed Stadia toward the chopping block.</li><li>Stadia arrived on the gaming scene with big ambitions in 2019 that included developing original exclusives that would make use of the platform’s cloud computing advantages. </li><li>But Google’s internal studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-shuts-down-internal-studios-changing-bus-1846146761" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">shuttered</a> less than 18 months after launch, and many of its ambitious cloud features like State Share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/google-stadia-had-big-disruptive-ideas-that-others-should-steal/1100-6507965/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">never made it to more than 10% of the platform</a>.</li><li>Ultimately, Stadia chief Harrison said the main culprit was a lack of growth: “While Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected.” </li><li>"The number one problem is the business model. Secondly, you need to deliver something consumers cannot get elsewhere," said Benjy Boxer, the co-founder of game streaming platform Parsec who now oversees the product at Unity. "In my opinion, the only way cloud gaming will ever shift to the mainstream is if we get to a point where we’re not selling the distribution technology and instead selling a unique value proposition." </li><li>Boxer said Stadia had "amazing technology" but failed at selling coherent product and experience. "Stadia never figured out who their customer was," he added.</li></ul><p><strong>It’s perhaps too early to draw broader conclusions about Stadia’s closure,</strong> what it could mean for cloud gaming as a whole, and whether the platform’s demise is the nail in the coffin for Google’s gaming ambitions. But Google’s sloppy handling of the announcement and Stadia’s stunning failure is evidence that even the largest, most experienced companies can find themselves lost in the woods when trying to crack such a notoriously difficult set of problems. </p><p>Cloud gaming is still available on platforms operated by Microsoft, Nvidia, and — for the time being — Amazon, too. But developing games is costly, difficult, and multidisciplinary work that takes years, and streaming those games over the cloud has yet to be accomplished in a sustainable fashion with an attractive business model. Google found this out the hard way, and let’s hope Stadia’s shutdown provides the road map that helps keep its competitors alive.</p><p><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Entertainment newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={This carbon capture startup wants to decarbonize the world’s biggest polluters https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-clean-point-source-capture Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:47:57 +0000 
<img src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/ceo-and-co-founder-of-carbon-clean-aniruddha-sharma.jpg?id=31859764&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C256%2C0%2C412"/><br/><br/><p>Carbon capture and storage has taken on <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/carbon-capture-venture-capital-investment" target="_self">increasing importance</a> as companies with stubborn emissions look for new ways to meet their net zero goals. For hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel production, it’s one of the few options that exist to help them get there. </p><p>Yet it’s proven incredibly challenging to scale the technology, which captures carbon pollution at the source. U.K.-based company Carbon Clean is leading the charge to bring down costs. This year, it raised a $150 million series C round, which the startup said is the largest-ever funding round for a point-source carbon capture company. </p><p>Carbon capture and storage is controversial in part due to the industries it serves; while cement and steel makers are among the industries that all but require CCS to lower emissions, oil and gas companies have also shown great interest. Carbon Clean’s latest funding round was led by Chevron, and the technology is seen as a potential lifeline for the fossil fuel industry, despite there being readily available alternatives like renewables and electric vehicles. </p><p>The technology has also been criticized for not delivering the emissions reductions it promises. That includes an infamous case last year involving none other than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/20/a-shocking-failure-chevron-criticised-for-missing-carbon-capture-target-at-wa-gas-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevron in Western Australia</a>, in which the company missed its targets, and a Shell blue hydrogen project that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shell-ccs-carbon-capture-1848401554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">emitted more carbon than it captured</a>. The <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105111" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Government Accountability Office</a> has also lambasted the Department of Energy for investing $1.1 billion in projects that largely failed to live up to expectations.</p><p>It’s against this backdrop that Carbon Clean is striving to clean up CCS’ image and deliver on its promise. Carbon Clean CEO Aniruddha Sharma told Protocol that fossil fuels are necessary, at least in the near term, to lift the living standards of those who don’t have access to cars and electricity.</p><p>While technologies like CCS hold a lot of promise, helping the world potentially address that issue while still meeting net zero goals, the risks of locking in more fossil fuel use are real, especially if Carbon Clean and other CCS companies can’t scale as promised. CCS also does nothing to help with other forms of local air pollution, which is a major public health concern. </p><p>Sharma, for his part, said he has “done nothing else but carbon capture” his professional life. Along with co-founder and CTO Prateek Bumb, he started working on Carbon Clean’s technology out of university. Bumb had done a five-month internship in Italy studying decarbonization science, and Sharma asked him who was doing that work in India. “No one,” he told him, and thus Carbon Clean was born.</p><p>He spoke to Protocol about what Carbon Clean has learned, the future of point-source CCS, as well as the role of companies like his in battling the climate crisis.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><p><strong>What’s the most challenging part of carbon capture that you’re still working through?</strong></p><p>Scale up is the most challenging part. The technology is working right now. Going from here to the next level of scale up, maybe 10 times bigger, is going to be interesting and challenging, both because you’re trying to increase the equipment size and you’re trying to increase our supply chain. Once you’ve got the materials, then you need a workshop or machining capacity capability that can actually produce the equipment specifically for you. But in the current atmosphere, that’s not something that’s necessarily available. So we’re spending a lot of time on how we scale up both the supply chain and the equipment and the delivery capability.</p><p><strong>You just raised a $150 million series C led by Chevron. A bulk of your investment comes from fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco and Equinor. How do you make sure your work isn’t just a way for them to pay to continue polluting?</strong></p><p>President Biden is asking oil and gas companies to produce more oil, but they’re not necessarily producing that much oil because the market doesn’t necessarily see producing fossil fuels as a good thing to do. So I think people realize that there is a need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and work towards the energy transition. </p><p>From our perspective, whenever you partner with companies like Chevron, we always look for proof in the pudding. Chevron has committed $10 billion to Chevron New Energies, which is solely working on decarbonization. If they have the biggest footprint today, they’re the ones that need the most help decarbonizing. </p><p><strong>How do you make sure the removal project doesn’t negatively impact the local communities adjacent to the carbon capture?</strong></p><p>I think the issue is much deeper: How does the energy transition in general impact the population and the people being affected by it? When these companies start reducing their production, there will be more jobs available and you can reorient a lot of them towards decarbonization. We’re also leading the creation of a new industry that actually didn’t exist. If you think about decarbonization and the level where we need to be — or should be — over the next 10 years, you’re talking about creating five companies the size of Exxon or Chevron in the decarbonization space. These companies will employ tens of thousands of people, so we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of job opportunities to be created for decarbonization. For our company, we ensure that the impact of what we’re trying to do is translated into the local communities.</p><p><strong>How much should your corporate clients be relying on your services when it comes to reaching their net zero or decarbonization goals? In other words, what proportion of their drawdown should come from emissions reductions versus paying for point-source carbon capture?</strong> </p><p>I generally advise our customers to diversify their options. I tell my customers that in 2024, get one unit at your site and spend 10% of your money for decarbonization using one of our carbon capture boxes, spend 10% for another form of decarbonization, and another 10% for electrification, and maybe another 10% for biomass. Try all the options across the board, so that within a year or two, you know which one or two options to scale up. Maybe carbon capture and electrification are the best options for you. If you’re in California, green hydrogen carbon capture is the perfect option for you, so we’re not saying that ours is the only solution. </p><p><strong>But how much of their decarbonization journey should come from any sort of carbon capture versus just not having that pollution be released at all?</strong></p><p>I think that’s where the conundrum is, right? We help decarbonize heavy industries like steel and cement, which are relatively difficult to replace in the medium term. </p><p><strong>But you also work with fossil fuel companies, for which there are renewable alternatives.</strong> </p><p>We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity? We have to keep using heavy industrial products for some time more. And we cannot allow them to just run like that; we have to decarbonize them today. </p><p class="pull-quote">"We focus on heavy industry that is really hard to replace in the medium term. Steel, cement, chemicals—we use these things on a daily basis. If we stop producing them, then how would we progress as humanity?"</p><p><strong>So is it your hope that eventually your company won’t have to exist?<br/><br/></strong>I think heavy industry will always exist. So we’ll always be there supporting the decarbonization. If you think about brute numbers, 2 billion people today don’t have access to electricity. <em>[Editor’s note: The International Energy Agency pegs that number at </em><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity" target="_blank"><em>770 million</em></a><em>.] </em>How much of an industrial output needs to be produced to elevate and alleviate poverty for 2 billion people? It’d be immoral to say, “Well, actually, you know what, steel and cement companies, stop tomorrow.”</p><p><strong>Bigger picture: How much CCS does the world need? Put a number on what you expect. A gigaton? Less? More?</strong></p><p>Let’s work backwards. Industrial emitters today contribute about 25% of the global carbon dioxide emissions, more or less. That’s about 10 billion tons of emissions. Even if you said that we will be able to electrify some of it or use hydrogen for some part of it, you would still need to decarbonize a significant chunk of that 10 billion tons using point-source carbon capture technologies, and they need to happen between now and 2040. As a company, we are focused on scaling our solution and the availability of that solution to a billion tons per year of carbon dioxide captured. </p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Musk may buy Twitter after all https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/musk-twitter-deal Tue, 04 Oct 2022 16:41:39 +0000

While most firms fell into the range of cutting staff two to three months after making funding announcements, a handful of companies waited two weeks or less after going public about funding rounds before making layoffs. </p><p><br/></p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" frameborder="0" height="450" id="datawrapper-chart-gI4RQ" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gI4RQ/5/" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Layoffs after announcing new funding"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r</script></div><p><br/></p><p>Are firms blowing through millions in the weeks after the check is deposited in the bank? Experts told Protocol that it's more complicated than that. Startups wait several months to a year after venture capital checks hit their bank account before going public with the news, but the delay can result in terrible optics and often a feeling of betrayal among those laid off. </p><h3> Keeping it quiet</h3><p>“By the time we're hearing about private companies raising capital … it's not actually reflective of when that work was actually done,” said Susan Alban, partner at Renegade Partners. A founder may not want their competitors to know about funding, or want to wait until there are other announcements to tack onto a funding round, like a product release or a new executive hire, to do a press push. </p><p>Funding details become more exclusive the bigger an organization gets. At a company with 100 employees, it's easier to keep the news of a major hire or a big VC check from slipping. But at a company with 2,000 people, “announcing it internally is announcing it publicly,” said Alban. “Even if you know everyone is under an NDA, you don't announce something at an all-hands with 2,000 people without expecting that it's going to be leaked.” </p><p>Like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/business/bolt-layoffs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bolt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1534872800439279618" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trade Republic</a>, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/07/01/homelight-lays-off-a-fifth-of-its-workers-weeks-after-raising-60m/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HomeLight</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/stord-slashes-jobs-after-new-funding-5884514/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stord</a> all drew attention from funding announcements that happened just weeks or days before layoffs.

Plus, big funding announcements don’t always equate to a company’s financial health. Travel startup <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/05/31/pollen-reported-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pollen</a> cut staff after raising funding and collapsed just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/the-next-fyre-fest-startup-pollen-leaves-people-seeking-refunds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three months later</a>. </p><p>Though it’s impossible to know the financial guts of a company from the outside, many will conduct layoffs to extend their runway, Anthony Kline, partner at The GP, told Protocol. Prior to the recent downturn, venture capitalists were “seeing a bit of a gold rush” in tech. But as things have slowed, funding rounds have become harder and harder to come by. “You're able to see the caboose now; you're not gonna see, like, an infinite line of cars.” </p><p>As the economy shifted, so did the role of the founder and CEO, Kline said, changing from “growth product leader to resource allocator.” Jobs that don’t directly align with generating revenue or are duplicate roles are first on the chopping block.</p><p>“If they don't assume that there's some additional round of funding that’s 12 months out, it might be 24 or 36 months out, then they have to be a little bit more creative and a little bit more resourceful,” Kline said. </p><h3>It sucks no matter what</h3><p>It’s difficult to predict if a company will have rocky times ahead, but smart leaders can plan ahead about when to announce funding. If the announcement comes months or a year after closing the round, it gives the illusion that a company is doing better than it is. And, optics aside, layoffs after funding announcements (and in general) are a blow to internal morale. Doing them in a transparent and thoughtful way is crucial. </p><p>Having employees be in the know about company details, financial standing, and what the future of the company looks like might help ease the blow of layoffs. “If people understand what their purpose is in a company, and that you see them for what it is that they're fulfilling, and you're helping this company succeed, that is like a tried-and-true strategy, and it takes time, it takes dedication, and I think it takes a lot of thoughtfulness from a founder,” said Kline. </p><p>Being present with your staff amid layoffs, especially in a time of increased remote work, is important to let employees know you’re not disconnected and you’re listening to how layoffs impact them. </p><p>“You see a lot of situations where a founder is so preoccupied with allocating resources, talking to investors, or talking to customers, that they're spending most of their time externally and less so internally,” Kline said.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Gary Gensler is keeping up with Kim Kardashian https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/protocol-fintech/kim-kardashian-emax-crypto-sec Tue, 04 Oct 2022 15:23:09 +0000

Kim Kardashian <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax" target="_self">agreed to pay a $1.26 million penalty</a> for failing to report that she got paid to endorse EMAX tokens. It’s a high-profile affirmation of the SEC’s controversial position that most cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities, and just like stock promoters, celebrities better follow the rules if they want to pitch a token to the public.</p><p><strong>Disclosure rules. </strong>“Ms. Kardashian’s case” is a reminder that celebrities must “disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities" like crypto tokens, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183" target="_blank">Gensler said</a>.</p><ul><li>The SEC had actually put out this warning even before Gensler’s time in the wake of the ICO craze a few years ago. In 2017, the regulator cautioned investors <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/statement-potentially-unlawful-promotion-icos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“to be wary of investment opportunities</a> that sound too good to be true” and of “paid endorsements from artists, sports figures, or other icons.”</li><li>The following year the SEC announced that boxer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-268" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Floyd Mayweather and music producer DJ Khaled</a> agreed to pay “disgorgement, penalties and interest” for failing to report that they got paid for touting initial coin offerings. </li></ul><p><strong>The cases underline the perils of celebrity endorsements in the world of investment finance,</strong> where “you can't be paid to promote a stock without disclosing that you're being paid,” Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco regional director, told Protocol. </p><ul><li>Online influencers make a living on hype. But in the world of securities, “overexuberance without proper disclosures and disclaimers is going to be considered misleading and is going to get people in hot water,” Andrew Lom, global head of private wealth at Norton Rose Fulbright, told Protocol. </li><li>Mike Fasanello, chief compliance officer at LVL, said “a seasoned businesswoman like Ms. Kardashian really should have known better considering her career is built largely on advertising and her public image.”</li></ul><p><strong>It’s a significant PR moment for the SEC. </strong>While the regulator has gone after other offending crypto celebrities, the Kardashian case is a “bigger win,” Fagel argued.</p><ul><li>She’s a huge celebrity, after all, whose popularity extends beyond the crypto and finance realms. “There are a lot more people reading about Kim Kardashian” than scouring other cases and news stories involving crypto, he told Protocol. The federal government “has an interest in bringing high-profile cases as a deterrent matter because it gets a lot more attention.”</li><li>In fact, the Kardashian case “may turn into the best public service announcement not to take investment advice from a celebrity,” Bill Callahan, director of government strategic affairs at Blockchain Intelligence Group. It could also serve as a “warning to others that they must settle their investigations by the SEC” and other law enforcement agencies.</li><li>The fine Kardashian has to pay is “a nominal penalty considering her overall net worth,” Fasanello said. But the SEC action “is meant to educate the masses rather than to penalize the individual.”</li></ul><p>“Simply being a crypto enthusiast publicly isn't going to get anyone in trouble,” even among celebrities, Melody Brue of Moor Insights & Strategy told Protocol. In other words, Matt Damon is probably off the hook for saying that “fortune favors the brave” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Crypto.com ad</a>. But trying to make money from touting crypto products is a serious matter, Brue added: “However vague you believe crypto as a security rule to be, it's clear Gensler is going to apply the same regulations, disclosure requirements, and marketing rules that are applied to securities.” </p><p><em>— Benjamin Pimentel (</em><a href="mailto:bpimentel@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="http://twitter.com/benpimentel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>A MESSAGE FROM ALIBABA</h3><br/><a class="rm-shortcode rm-image-link" data-rm-shortcode-id="8959dd775f8b0d912fadd71e203ba533" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6123996622&iu=/21901267728" id="daa0e" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="" loading="lazy" src="https://www.protocol.com/media-library/image.png?id=31843641&width=980"/></a><p>Alibaba — a leading global ecommerce company — is a particularly powerful engine in helping American businesses of every size sell goods to more than 1 billion consumers on its digital marketplaces in China.

The outcome could make or break an industry increasingly central to tech companies meeting their net zero goals.</p><p>Globally, Verra — short for the Verified Carbon Standard — issues roughly two-thirds of the carbon credits on the voluntary market, including credits for renewable energy and forestry and land use, among other types. Established in 2007, the registry is the longtime face of the market’s status quo.</p><p>But as demand has surged for carbon credits — particularly as the tech industry looks to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/carbon-offsets-shopping-ecommerce" target="_self">meet its net zero targets</a> by offsetting a (<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/climate/tech-climate-plan-tips?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_blank">small</a>) portion of its emissions — it has become increasingly clear that scaling the credit market will first require clear standards and transparency. In fact, this is precisely the conclusion that forced a 400-member industry task force on scaling the market <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/carney-s-bid-to-boost-carbon-market-scaled-back-amid-controversy?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to change tack</a> in 2021. In its wake, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market emerged. It published proposed reforms — including establishing an agreed-upon definition for credit quality and evaluating methodologies accordingly — in July. </p><p>While Verra initially supported the effort, it has since taken issue with the specifics of even these modest potential reforms. Last week, the organization demanded that the council make a “course correction” and took particular issue with the approach that gives credit types that meet the quality definition a thumbs-up in a note to stakeholders.</p><p>“We especially fear that the principles-based review of programs has been supplanted with a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach that seeks to directly set the scope and rules of the market,” Verra wrote in mid-September. Verra also argued for program-by-program evaluation rather than one that evaluates the quality of specific credit types.</p><p>In a <a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/verra-integrity-council" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new analysis</a>, the climate research nonprofit CarbonPlan said Verra’s objection was “melodramatic” and “about control.” </p><p>“The Integrity Council is running a voluntary, opt-in labeling effort — nothing more,” the CarbonPlan team wrote last week. “The Integrity Council isn’t proposing to do anything about credits that fall short of its standards, nor is it clear how they could if they wanted to.”</p><p>Carbon markets are essentially the Wild West. Countless methodologies exist to define what makes for a quality credit, and imposing order on any lawless frontier is proving to be a challenge. But the stakes couldn’t be higher. </p><p>A <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/reform-needed-to-unlock-550-billion-carbon-offsets-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF analysis</a> found that the carbon offset market could be worth as much as $550 billion by 2050, a time period when net zero commitments will come due. However, absent global standard-setting, it is possible that there won’t be enough quality offsets to keep up to the demand. That could mean a lot of money gets wasted on ineffective credits while causing the planet to overheat to dangerous levels. </p><p>The fact that this initial attempt does not have the support of the voluntary market’s biggest player does not bode well. CarbonPlan speculated that at the root of Verra’s objection is a concern that its credits are not “robust enough” to meet the benchmark set out by the council’s proposal, and that new standards “could threaten their dominant position on the supply side of the voluntary market.”</p><p>Verra, for its part, maintains that its concerns are with the process’s efficiency, not with its proposed scrutiny. </p><p>“We don’t wish to see good projects unable to move ahead because the methodology they are using is waiting too long in line for its assessment,” Andrew Howard, Verra’s senior director for climate policy and strategy, told Protocol. “Verra is confident the VCS program will meet the ICVCM’s quality thresholds.”</p><p>Verra proposed several specific “course corrections” for the council, ostensibly with efficiency in mind. First, it argued for evaluating entire programs rather than specific credit types or methodologies. CarbonPlan said that approach “doesn’t pass the laugh test” given that it would force the council to give the whole swath of Verra credits a thumbs-up without acknowledging how much, for instance, a renewable energy credit’s methodology might differ from that of a forestry credit. </p><p>“That is no way to confront the well-documented challenges in the voluntary carbon markets, many of which are present in Verra’s offerings, and it would force the Integrity Council to either bless most of the market uncritically or categorically exclude its largest player,” CarbonPlan said. </p><p>In response, Verra said the council should sample or use spot checks to make sure all of a program’s credit types deserve the council’s approval, but that relying on a methodology-by-methodology evaluation rather than more efficient approaches would leave the council at risk of “seriously bogged down.” </p><p>Verra also took issue with the proposal to step up standards over time and suggested that the council use existing aviation industry offset standards. Taking that approach, though, would ignore the very real need for sharper offset standards and the reality that the aviation industry’s standards are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-un-just-made-it-easier-for-airlines-to-pollute-1844251411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rife with loopholes</a>.</p><p>Regardless of what shape the council’s final reforms take, though, Verra doesn’t have to participate in the council’s proposed benchmarking if it doesn’t want to. If the registry does opt out, it would seriously undermine the scope of any new standards by making two in three carbon credits exempt. </p><p>That puts the council in the midst of a tug-of-war as Verra pulls it to change its plan and CarbonPlan and its other supporters urge it to stay the course. Should the council allow itself to be swayed by Verra’s concerns, CarbonPlan said it could put its very independence at risk.</p><p>“Either [the council members] accede to Verra’s demands and abandon any claim to independence, or they forge ahead and work with only a minority of the current market,” CarbonPlan <a href="https://twitter.com/carbonplanorg/status/1575549005265653760" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summarized via Twitter</a>. “We hope they will choose the latter.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={White House AI Bill of Rights lacks specific recommendations for AI rules https://www.protocol.com/policy/ostp-ai-bill-of-rights Tue, 04 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

And, linking to an article about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveillance tech used in China</a> to track and control the Muslim minority Uyghur population there, they alluded to use of AI by autocracies “as a tool of state-sponsored oppression, division, and discrimination.”</p><p class="pull-quote">I categorically reject that kind of framing of it,” Nelson told Protocol. “The document moves as the title says from principles to practice.</p><p>Soon after the announcement, OSTP held several <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/11/10/join-the-effort-to-create-a-bill-of-rights-for-an-automated-society/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public listening sessions</a> in November 2021 on AI-enabled biometric technologies, consumer and “smart city” products, and AI used for employment, education, housing, health care, social welfare, financial services, and in the criminal justice system.</p><p>While some advocacy groups have indicated <a href="https://www.caidp.org/statements/ostp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">frustration with the slow process</a> for publishing the AI Bill of Rights, Nelson said by one measure — the Biden-Harris administration’s <a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Summit for Democracy</a> held in December 2021 — it is actually early. <br/><br/>“We had committed by December to finish this, and we are completing it with a little bit of time to spare,” Nelson said.</p><p>Scandal has plagued OSTP this year. Former OSTP Director <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/07/eric-lander-resigns-00006545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lander resigned In February</a> amid accusations he created “an atmosphere of intimidation at OSTP through flagrant verbal abuse.” Later in March, POLITICO revealed that Lander had helped enable an organization led by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">former Google CEO Eric Schmidt to pay the salaries of some OSTP staff.<br/><br/></a>Lawmakers have proposed legislation that would take ethical commitments made by the government out of the realm of theory and into practice. Legislation introduced in February, for example, would <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/revised-algorithmic-accountability-bill-ai" target="_self">require companies to assess the impact of AI</a> and automated systems they use to make decisions affecting people’s employment, finances, and housing and require those companies to submit annual reports about assessments to the FTC.</p><p>Despite a lack of federal AI laws or regulations, the U.S. has agreed to uphold international <a href="https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">principles established in 2019 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> that call on makers and users of AI systems to be held accountable for them, and ensure they respect human rights and democratic values including privacy, non-discrimination, fairness, and labor rights. Those principles also called on AI builders and users to make sure that the systems are transparent, provide understandable and traceable explanations for their decisions, and are safe and secure.</p><p>In conjunction with the publication of the AI Bill of Rights, other federal agencies are expected to signal commitment to take actions reflective of its tenets. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services plans to release recommendations for methods to reduce algorithmic discrimination in health care AI and the Department of Education is planning to release recommendations on the use of AI for teaching and learning by early 2023.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={The US is set to expand controls on chip tech for China this week https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/us-china-chips-export-controls Mon, 03 Oct 2022 23:01:22 +0000

Thursday’s announcement is expected to include export controls on chipmaking tools.</p><p>In late August, Nvidia and AMD disclosed they had received notification letters from the Commerce Department ordering them to halt sales of chips designed for artificial intelligence computing.

High-bandwidth memory (which is useful for training large AI models) and flash were among the memory technologies under consideration, the people said. </p><p>Administration officials had been briefed by several memory manufacturers about establishing specific thresholds for flash and high-bandwidth memory, according to another person familiar with the discussions.

The stakes for the legal status quo underpinning the entirety of modern social media are potentially <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/texas-elon-musk-free-speech?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">huge</a>, and the outcome is far from certain.</p><p><strong>The Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/supreme-court-scrutinize-us-protections-social-media-2022-10-03/" target="_blank">said</a> it will hear <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gonzalez-v-google-llc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a case</a> involving terrorist content on YouTube and whether or not Section 230 immunizes platforms’ algorithms.</strong></p><ul><li>Section 230, of course, says that web platforms, from newspaper comment sections and email providers to Big Tech platforms like Google, can’t be sued over posts that are “provided by another” — a.k.a., by users.</li><li>One of the many, many questions swirling around this law is, when do platforms become so involved with the content that they cease to be separate from users, and can be sued?</li><li>Is it when they were alerted to content by user reports? How about when they promote the content through algorithms? When they add their own warning about it?</li></ul><p><strong>Up until now, federal districts and appeals courts have basically ruled “no” to all of the above,</strong> reasoning that if any were the case, platforms would have to either check almost every single post or ignore all of them.</p><ul><li>Both extremes would be bad for business — a big concern at the dawn of the internet age, in 1996, when the law passed.</li><li>Checking every post (and taking down all the ones that raise any worry of even frivolous litigation) obviously would be bad for free speech.</li><li>But creating a free-for-all would make platforms intensely toxic. The moderation that platforms <em>do</em> do is both arguably both <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/meta-midterms-global-democracy-2023" target="_self">insufficient</a> and also the only thing making some platforms tolerable. </li></ul><p>Under that legal approach, the algorithms that order and recommend content — which, from a technological point of view, are basically the entire point and purpose of social media — <strong>don’t create lawsuit risk for the platforms.</strong></p><ul><li>Nor do fact-checks, labels, failures to act on warnings, and lots of other things.</li><li>It’s not just takedowns and other forms of moderation: Leaving content up and doing nothing with it is also completely fine, under the law.</li></ul><p>Of course, <strong>there’s bipartisan anger that this setup creates huge levels of harm without recourse for those who got hurt, even as some tech companies have gotten very rich.</strong></p><ul><li>Much of that anger focuses on harm that happens at algorithmic scale — whether it’s the spread of child sexual abuse material or mass harassment — because of boosting by Big Tech companies’ very <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/design-wars-ca" target="_self">own</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/california-privacy-transparency?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self">designs</a>.</li><li>The case — and an additional case the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/twitter-inc-v-taamneh/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will hear</a> involving Twitter — involves terrorist content and attacks, and could offer SCOTUS the ability to narrow court interpretation about just how free social services are to be, well, what they are.</li><li>There may be <a href="https://twitter.com/jkosseff/status/1576934189643239424" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real appetite</a> for that kind of narrowing, in fact: The justices appear to have taken up the issue despite the lack of any disagreement in circuit courts, which is more often what <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/section-230-snap" target="_self">prompts</a> them to hear a case.</li></ul><p>By the way, if you thought it was a different issue that touched on Section 230 and seemed <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/hb20-fifth-circuit-stay" target="_self">destined for the Supreme Court</a> — namely,<strong> whether states can require platforms to host conservative content — the justices still could take that up too.</strong></p><p><strong>Both sets of cases create huge uncertainty for tech, though of course a ruling confirming the status quo is possible in both.</strong></p><ul><li>The court may also decide to rule narrowly and only find a small loophole for existing statutes on terrorist content.</li><li>Maybe the justices will follow the framing of the Twitter case and sidestep algorithms altogether, focusing instead on liability in anti-terrorism law.</li><li>But the breadth of potential questions is staggering here, including free speech and design.</li></ul><p>And unlike most of the contentious issues, where the ideological lineup of the court is a good predictor of the outcome, <strong>Section 230 has <a href="https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1576933341894705152" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foes</a> and defenders on both sides, and for the most part, we don’t know where the nine justices fall.</strong></p><ul><li>The one exception is arch-conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-section-230" target="_self">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/clarence-thomas-230-meta" target="_self">called</a> for narrowing when companies get to benefit from the law and for expanding the circumstances where they’re responsible for content.</li></ul><p>I wrote a few weeks ago that the possibility of the Supreme Court taking up the Florida and Texas laws had a real “<a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/texas-scotus-issues?rebelltitem=4" target="_self">season finale</a>” vibe — no one knows what’s going to happen and seemingly everything is on the table.

Microsoft Solutions Partners also can earn specializations and expert program status that recognize their expertise and experience in specific technical scenarios under each solution area. </p><p>“What I think is unique about the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is it gives customers total clarity on the partner that has the designations, the specializations that are a great fit for their needs for whatever unique cloud solutions they’re looking for or the transformation that they’re trying to get after,” Dezen said. “It’s like a clear road map, so to speak.”</p><p>A 12-year Microsoft veteran, Dezen most recently served as corporate vice president of device partner sales.

What this means for partners is that they get to differentiate themselves in a very competitive market to customers.</p><p>It’s a really important moment to showcase to partners that we are evolving … as the market is evolving, and we are introducing new capabilities in our programs that let partners focus on their own innovation, leverage our R&D investments, and help customers. The program makes it very easy for partners to understand the things that they need to do to activate all of the resources that we uniquely deliver to partners, whether that’s our R&D investments, our go-to-market scale and capability, or innovation.</p><p>Partners can plug in via skilling, incentives, [or] investments to make sure that they’re getting the best of what I think is Microsoft’s unique differentiation, which is our tech stack plus the combination of the way we go to market, which is the asset of our commercial marketplace combined with our 35,000 [Microsoft field] sellers.</p><p><strong>What’s been the reaction among partners?</strong></p><p>We’ve spent the last six months talking to partners, listening to their feedback, answering their questions. I’m really optimistic that the partners are excited about what we’re doing. They’re excited about the [timing] of this. They see that the portfolio of assets that we’re bringing together with a trusted platform, services, products, and investments for them are so aligned to the way that customers are actually buying products. And it’s aligned to the way that Microsoft sells, so it’s an accelerant for the partners.</p><p><strong>What percentage of partners have decided to join the new program versus renewing their legacy statuses for a year?</strong></p><p>We’re not disclosing specific numbers, but what I will say is partners have the ability to start earning designations immediately. And for partners that aren’t quite ready — first of all, we’re leaning in with resources to help partners make that shift — but they can continue to enjoy their competency benefits uninterrupted through their annual term. They can even renew those benefits after the Silver and Gold badges have retired.</p><p>When Microsoft announced the new program in March, it said partners’ preliminary partner capability scores would be available then, and they had to achieve at least 70 points out of 100 to earn a designation. What percentage of partners needed Microsoft’s help in getting to 70 points?</p><p>Every partner is in a different place on their journey. We have broad-reaching guidance through our partner center that tells partners exactly how they can improve their score in the different categories: performance, skilling, and customer success. Partners can start earning those designations immediately. There are some partners that are well on their way. </p><p>Partners still remain our partners regardless of their designation, and so we’re always going to look for ways to support our partners through any evolutions that are happening with us and in the market. I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are. But I really believe that this program is the thing that’s going to differentiate partners, and so it’s in our interest, in our partners’ interest, and frankly, in the customers’ interests, for partners to lean in and do this work with us.</p><p><strong>The economy has tumbled since Microsoft announced the changes that take effect today. Were any considerations given to partners that might be experiencing economic challenges?</strong></p><p>I actually think the time is better than ever. This is a challenging market, there’s no question about it, but customers need help. They need help to digitally transform, and it’s in their economic interest to do that. We’re giving partners the skills, the resources, the assets, and the partnership to enable them to show customers how they can run their businesses more cost-effectively digitally.</p><p class="pull-quote">I recognize sometimes change is hard for people, and so we’re going to meet partners where they are.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the changes coming with the industry designations for ISVs?</strong></p><p>There are actually two immediate investments that we’re making around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/program-benefits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ISV Success</a>, which is the pathway for ISVs within the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program, and then the industry designations. Those are going to be available later this year. They will differentiate solutions based on the demonstrated performance with customers, their technical maturity, and customer success. The first three industries are health care, retail, and financial services. It’s designed with the intent that it will help these ISVs differentiate their solutions by both industry-specific scenarios as well as the broader technology and line-of-business capabilities.</p><p><strong>Can you give a sneak peek of anything else that’s coming after these changes?</strong></p><p>The way to think about it is the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program is designed for every partner. We want to invite every partner to participate in it. So the things that you could expect to see in the future are more design capabilities for partners like device partners, mixed-reality partners, learning partners, success partners. We’ll have more specific capabilities roll out as we advance the program.</p><p><strong>What are some common problems or challenges that partners have communicated to you?</strong></p><p>Partners are deciding how quickly they can evolve and modernize their businesses. That’s pretty core to the discussions that we have with partners all the time: How can we help them? How can we help them make more money? How can we help them run thriving, profitable businesses to help their own employees?</p><p>We just published [Microsoft-commissioned research] <a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/microsoft-ecosystem-value-new-data-reveals-partner-paths-to-profitability-and-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from IDC</a>. It’s a great illustration: It talks about how partners that invest with Microsoft see distinct business value and growth. There’s really two things that popped for me. One was that partners that engage deeply with Microsoft see faster growth and higher margins. Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year. The second one is around co-selling and going to market with us. The research showed that the most successful partners we have are engaging across the variety of go-to-market resources with us. These are partners that develop differentiated, value-added approaches to customers that align with Microsoft’s strategy. </p><p class="pull-quote">Partners that invested across all six of our solution areas are estimated to grow revenues by 47% this year.</p><p><strong>Are there any emerging technology areas where you’d like to see more partners investing in?</strong></p><p>I’d like to see more partners in all of our solution areas. The party’s open. There are some things that are very timely: certainly security, data, and AI. These are very hot and relevant topics for customers right now, and so that’s pretty core to the conversations that we’re having with our partners.</p><p><strong>Are you going to get involved in trying to bring more female-led partners into the program and promoting greater diversity overall?</strong></p><p>I have a massive responsibility to be a loud voice for diversity and representation in the ecosystem. Any things that we can do to help more diverse partner types participate in our programs, build their own businesses with Microsoft, and then help customers, for me that’s not just a professional win, it’s a personal one.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Tech recruiters' best tips for sourcing talent on LinkedIn https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/best-practices-linkedin-talent-sourcing Mon, 03 Oct 2022 16:54:39 +0000

Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p><hr/><p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul><p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul><p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul><p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul></ul><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><div><em>A version of this story appeared in Protocol’s Workplace newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/" target="_self"><u><em>Sign up here</em></u></a><em> to get it in your inbox three times a week.</em></div> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Kim Kardashian will pay $1.26 million over crypto post, SEC says https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/kardashian-gensler-sec-settlment-emax Mon, 03 Oct 2022 13:05:05 +0000

Since then the landscape for productivity startups trying to make it on their own has completely changed, especially for those pandemic darlings that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=16f2286b6490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flourished in the all-remote world</a>. </p><p>As recession looms, companies looking to cut costs are less likely to spend money on tools outside of their Microsoft or Google workplace bundles. Enterprise platforms are bulking up and it could spell trouble for the productivity startups trying to unseat them. But Notion COO Akshay Kothari says the company is still aiming to build the next Microsoft, not be the next Microsoft. And in a move signaling a new chapter of maturity, Notion has hired its first chief financial officer: Rama Katkar, Instacart’s former VP of finance.</p><p>Figma, which Kothari called a “sister company” to Notion, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/adobe-to-acquire-figma" target="_self">decided to join Adobe</a> for $20 billion instead of beating them. But Notion is hungry for more. Unlike other startups that have pared down during the downturn, Notion has <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-flowdash-acquisition-tender-offer" target="_self">gone on the offensive</a> with acquisitions of calendar app Cron and workflow app Flowdash, as well as launching a global ad campaign. Notion also retained its valuation after <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/sequoia-index-purchase-shares-from-notion-employees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">employees sold shares to investors in a tender offer</a>. Kothari said he doesn’t feel Notion has to “entertain any discussions” about being acquired; there’s more room for Notion to grow, he said, both in the consumer and enterprise spaces. </p><p>“It's almost not worth thinking about the hypotheticals because there's just so much that is left to be done, that we could do ourselves,” Kothari said. </p><h3>IPO or no? </h3><p>Katkar’s hire is a sign Notion may even go public in the near future. The CFO has some experience in this area (Katkar prepped Instacart for its impending, and lately <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instacart-plans-to-focus-ipo-on-selling-employee-shares-11663581602" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">somewhat troubled</a>, IPO.) When Protocol asked about Notion’s IPO plans, she didn’t commit to a “yes” or “no.” Instead, Katkar said Notion is “focused on building” and tackling the international knowledge worker market. </p><p>Whenever a late-stage private company hires a CFO, that means they’re thinking about “the next step,” Wing Venture Capital partner Zach DeWitt said. Going public is typically this next step, and so hiring a CFO with public company or IPO-readiness experience is the way to go. “Usually around $5 million of revenue is when a company starts talking about a VP of finance,” DeWitt said. “By the time the company has $50 million of ARR, they should definitely have a CFO, in the majority of cases.”</p><p>At Instacart and before that at Credit Karma, Katkar developed the financial processes and functions necessary for a maturing company. These IPO-readiness skills apply to private companies too, she noted. </p><p>“That concept of public company readiness is just a framework,” Katkar said. “But in reality, I think even large private companies benefit from operating that way.”</p><p>Katkar was the No. 2 financial officer at both Instacart and Credit Karma, and she feels ready to take on the CFO role. Notion was at the top of her list for its simultaneous consumer and enterprise focus, Katkar said. </p><h3>B to C to B</h3><p>Kothari describes Notion as a “B2C2B” company. Notion doesn’t target CIOs, but rather consumers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/notion-conference-enterprise-productivity-influencer" target="_self">who then work to formalize Notion</a> inside their companies, the so-called <a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/cio-shadow-it-saas" target="_self">shadow IT</a> or, in Notion world, “Notion Champions.” Lately, Notion has been working on making its product more translatable for large companies, adding <a href="https://www.notion.so/releases/2022-08-29" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more admin controls and specific workspaces for teams</a>. But Kothari said he’s not forcing Notion into the enterprise at this point. </p><p>“Eventually, we'll get to a point where we can actually go up to the CIO of a company, who's never heard of Notion, and convince them to roll out Notion company-wide,” Kothari said. “But most of the work right now is happening through the employees, through the community.”</p><p>Notion’s ad campaign, with billboards in London, Paris, Seoul, Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco, emphasizes the note-taking tool’s ability to help organize personal life, not just work. Kothari also pointed to the company’s New York City and San Francisco pop-up stands offering bucket hats and coffee as part of the broader brand campaign. This type of branding, as well as the company’s investment in and popularity on TikTok, helps target Gen Z and students who might become Notion worker-champions someday. </p><p>“We can put our energy into making sure our consumers get to use the product for free because we know that downstream, that leads to a B2B business being built in the long run,” Kothari said. </p><p>But Notion’s B2B approach is ultimately not as strong when going up against enterprise software giants with stronger distribution models. DeWitt pointed out that Notion’s valuation is similar to Figma’s at $10 billion, making it a potential candidate for a lucrative acquisition someday. “I’m sure there are some large companies, like Microsoft would be a natural buyer here, maybe even Salesforce, that are thinking about potentially acquiring Notion,” DeWitt said. “It’s a great category, a great team, a great product. It’s got a lot of momentum.”</p><p>Kothari said he feels a close kinship with Figma, as the two companies had similar growth trajectories and similar <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/adobe-figma-dylan-field-user-reactions" target="_self">obsessive, loyal user bases</a>. He’s known CEO Dylan Field for over a decade. The Adobe deal shows “how much existing legacy companies really appreciate the power of these new businesses,” Kothari said. </p><p>Kothari has been through acquisitions twice, with LinkedIn buying his content platform Pulse, and then Microsoft buying LinkedIn. Kothari said it’s not in the cards for Notion, at least not right now. </p><p>“When [Notion CEO] Ivan was recruiting me, he said, do you want to work at Microsoft or do you want to build the next Microsoft?” Kothari said. “I’m personally excited about continuing to build here and seeing if we can continue to remain independent.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Securing the enterprise https://www.protocol.com/manuals/securing-the-enterprise/ Mon, 03 Oct 2022 11:00:00 +0000

Another 23% have too thin a credit file to score or no file at all. That puts them in a credit trap: To build credit, these consumers need someone to give them a line of credit with which they can demonstrate good financial habits. But with scores that low, few lenders are prepared to offer them anything. </p><p>Neobanks say they can solve the problem through a new twist on secured credit cards. But regulators are already scrutinizing their offerings.</p><p>Secured credit cards have been an answer to the thin-credit problem <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/build-credit-with-secured-credit-card/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for decades</a> because they allow subprime borrowers to open a line of credit when they otherwise can’t by depositing cash upfront. That sum determines the borrower’s credit limit, and gives the banks collateral to hold on to in case of default. However, most require several hundred dollars as a deposit and impose <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/securedcard.asp#:~:text=Secured%20credit%20cards%20generally%20come,lower%2Dcost%20forms%20of%20credit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hefty interest rates and fees</a>, which low-income borrowers struggle to afford.</p><h3>Payback time?</h3><p>Neobanks say they can avoid those problems and still help users build credit through secured credit cards that allow customers to repay their credit balance directly using their deposited cash, rather than keeping that money set aside. The products allow customers to build credit while paying for everyday expenses, neobanks say, without having to save up extra cash first. </p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank describe it as a win-win for consumers and fintechs — consumers can raise their credit scores, and the neobanks earn loyal customers. </p><p>But some in the industry see red flags. “They are, functionally, prepaid credit cards,” fintech analyst Alex Johnson told Protocol. That raises the concern that neobanks may be helping users increase their credit score with a tool that doesn't actually indicate their ability to repay. “If I was a lender, I’d be pissed about having to untangle the trade lines in these consumers’ credit files in order to make sure I wasn’t mistakenly granting credit to high-risk applicants.”</p><p>Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards each have similar mechanics: First, a user moves money from a checking account into a separate credit-builder account. The amount of money they move determines their credit limit: If a user moves $200 into the credit-builder account, they can spend up to $200 on a linked secured credit card. Then, at the end of the payment period, users can pay off their credit card balances with the money they’ve deposited — in this example, that same $200. Both Varo and Chime also allow users to sign up for automatic payments. </p><p>Varo and GO2bank told Protocol that it’s that third step — having to pay off the credit card at the end of the payment period — that makes the cards credit cards, not prepaid debit cards. Late payment or failure to repay can damage users’ credit scores. GO2bank additionally charges up to $39 for a late payment. Chime declined to answer any questions for this story. </p><p>With this distinction, neobanks are subject to regulations that govern credit but not debit cards, like the <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_truth-in-lending-act.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Truth in Lending Act</a>. They also, crucially, can market the cards as credit-building tools. The companies make 1% to 2% more in interchange on credit cards than they do on debit cards, <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-marshall-introduce-bipartisan-credit-card-competition-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">though pending legislation</a> may curb these fees.</p><p>Visa, on whose network Chime, Varo, and GO2bank’s secured credit cards are issued, did not respond to questions about whether the cards resemble prepaid debit cards. Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion also did not respond to questions about whether the cards accurately indicate customers’ ability to repay. </p><p>Varo and Go2Bank both say they are not worried about pending legislation changing the amount they can charge on interchange because the credit-building products are not a core source of profit. Rather, representatives of both banks told Protocol the product serves to help them meet customer needs and thus build goodwill with their users. “We’re building deeper connections and deeper engagement,” Raktim Mitra, Varo’s head of credit cards, told Protocol. </p><p>The CFPB acknowledged Varo and Chime’s secured credit-builder products in its <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-credit-card-market-report_2021.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021 Consumer Credit Card Market Report</a>, without mentioning whether the products might deserve further scrutiny. When Protocol asked the bureau for an update on its views, a spokesperson said that “the CFPB is aware of this market development, and we are monitoring this issue closely.” </p><h3>A spot of ambiguity</h3><p>For consumer advocates, the ambiguity around such programs is a symptom of a larger problem: The CFPB has yet to bring neobanks fully under its regulatory purview. Under the law that created it, the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-examinations/institutions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bureau can supervise</a> financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets and certain participants in consumer financial markets, like those that work in consumer reporting, debt collection, or the servicing of some loans. </p><p>The bureau invoked a dormant authority to investigate nonbank fintechs in April of this year, though consumer advocates <a href="https://consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFPB-CFA%20Fact-Sheet-CFPB-and-non-banks.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have been advocating</a> for more regular and thorough supervision. “There’s no accountability as of right now,” said Rachel Gittleman, head of financial services outreach at the Consumer Federation of America. </p><p>Gittleman’s primary concern with the credit-builders is that consumers may not understand they are using a lending product, despite the terms and conditions laid out in fine print. Though Chime, Varo, and GO2bank each market their products explicitly as secured credit cards, they <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/varo-bank-introduces-varo-believe-a-new-and-better-way-for-millions-of-americans-to-build-credit-301235475.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">downplay</a> possible negative impacts on a customer’s credit, and automatic payment options make the products feel more like a regular debit card that doesn’t have default risk.

Today, we’re learning the best ways to source talent on LinkedIn — especially if you’re short on time and resources (read: recruiters). Plus, we’re reading Elon’s text messages from Larry Ellison, Jason Calicanis, and Joe Rogan.</em></p><p class=""><em>— Allison Levitsky, reporter (</em><a href="mailto:alevitsky@protocol.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>email</em></a><em> | </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Levitskyyy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>twitter</em></a><em>)</em></p><h3>LinkedIn recruiting secrets</h3><br/><p>Companies like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/technology/meta-hiring-freeze.html" target="_blank">Meta</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/27/lyft-freezes-all-us-hiring-amid-stock-slump-economic-downturn/" target="_blank">Lyft</a> have stopped hiring for the year, and that’s music to the ears of other tech companies that are still staffing up. Much of talent sourcing still takes place on LinkedIn, but many recruiters have found their own techniques to use the service more efficiently. We asked LinkedIn’s VP of talent acquisition and three outside recruiters for their best LinkedIn hacks for sourcing talent.</p>
<p><strong>When reaching out, short and sweet is key. </strong>When sending a connection request, executive recruiter Darrell Rosenstein said he rarely sends more than three sentences or 150 characters.</p><ul><li>“If you’re at 300 characters, you’re way over for a candidate,” Rosenstein said.</li><li>Rosenstein also doesn’t ask for an appointment or include a Calendly link in the first message to a candidate. “That’s a second email,” Rosenstein said. “After they’ve connected, then for sure.”</li><li>Specific, well-informed messages targeted to the candidate are crucial to getting a good response rate — by all means, don’t “spray and pray,” said Shawn Cole, co-founder and president of Cowen Partners. “We do not want to be the agency that sends out stupid messages.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Focus on skills, not pedigree. </strong>Erin Scruggs, VP of talent acquisition at LinkedIn, said skills — which candidates can list on their profiles — are the “future currency” of recruiting, particularly in a tight labor market.</p><ul><li>“Everything we’re doing on the product is about contextualizing skills, and understanding how skills of one role map to another role,” Scruggs said. “If you’ve got somebody who’s a cashier, they may very likely have the same skills as a customer service rep.”</li><li>This can be particularly useful for employers that don’t have as much name recognition or as strong of a “talent brand,” Scruggs said. It can also help a team source more diverse hires.</li><li>Employers that aren’t yet a household name may want to consider skipping the first page of search results — maybe even checking out the candidates on the last page, Scruggs said. “They may not come from the five companies you typically hire from, but it helps you think a little bit more broadly about who could do the job, who’s capable of doing the job,” Scruggs said. “That sometimes helps you go for the people that haven’t been pinged 35 times in the last week.”</li></ul>
<p><strong>Post content to your company LinkedIn page to build a recruiting brand. </strong>Particularly for lesser-known startups, content can offer a glimpse into your company culture and personality.</p><ul><li>“I follow thousands of talent acquisition professionals,” Scruggs said. “When I go to hire, I have sort of an affinity bias towards people whose posts that I’ve really enjoyed or people who have been really insightful along the way. I think the reverse is true: Employers can create their talent brand by being really intentional about what they post.”</li><li>Outside recruiters can use this tactic as well. As an executive recruiter, Rosenstein said he posts content to his own profile that helps him engage candidates and raise his response rates.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Try LinkedIn’s “best-kept secret”: affinity groups. </strong>Paige Scott, who leads the Asset Management practice at the recruiting firm Kingsley Gate Partners in San Francisco, said groups are one of her favorite LinkedIn features for reaching candidates.</p><ul><li>Groups can reach a targeted set of users like financial officers of health tech startups, for example. Reaching out through groups can be particularly helpful for those who haven’t ponied up for LinkedIn’s premium subscription options, she said.</li><li>“It’s probably the best-kept secret on LinkedIn,” Scott said. “Groups are an incredible way to reach a bigger, broader audience without having to trigger different licenses.”</li></ul><h3>'Haha cool'</h3><br/><p>The world got a glimpse into Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" target="_blank">text inbox</a> this week thanks to his ongoing legal battle with Twitter. Now we know what tech’s power brokers really want: for Twitter to be an “open source protocol” rather than a company (Jack Dorsey), for Musk to move Twitter’s headquarters to Austin and force employees back to the office (Jason Calacanis), and a 24-hour edit button (Gayle King).</p>
<p>Larry Ellison, Reid Hoffman, and Joe Rogan are in there, too. </p>

So what’s next? According to Miller, the next era, including the rivalry between the U.S. and China, is all about computing power.</p><p>That tech rivalry and the story of how the chip industry got from four to 11.8 billion transistors are all part of Miller’s book, “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology,” which comes out Oct. 4. “Chip War” outlines the nature of the coming battle over semiconductors, showing how the power to produce leading-edge chips fell into the hands of just five companies: three from the U.S., one from Japan, and one from the Netherlands. </p><p>In an interview with Protocol, Miller touched on the evolving military uses of semiconductors, Russia’s chip procurement problems, and whether onshoring chips won’t necessarily increase the likelihood of a conflict between the U.S. and China. </p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><strong>You write about how the Persian Gulf War became a pivotal moment for understanding the role microchips would play in warfare, especially with guided missiles. Are missiles still the use-case where the military needs the most advanced chips, or has that shifted to other areas like artificial intelligence or cyber attacks?</strong></p><p>I wouldn't necessarily think about individual weapon systems. Chips are important in those weapon systems, but there's also the broader integration of sensors to decision-makers, communication technologies, [and] weapon systems — all of which rely on chips of different sorts. </p><p>So it's the integration that matters as much as the capabilities of any individual system. But as more and more systems start to become more autonomous, the demands for computing power, memory, and communication bandwidth increase on all of these systems. </p><p>So yes, semiconductors are still very important in terms of advances in specific types of munitions, but it's also [about] the ability to integrate them, to transfer information between them, and to have them working together — and all that requires advanced semiconductors at every stage of the process. Militaries are confronting semiconductors everywhere they turn, and their ability to access the right types of semiconductors and more advanced chips is crucial for every aspect of the modern battlefield.</p><p><strong>What’s Russia’s status with the ability to procure semiconductors? There were reports that Russia was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-chips-are-down-russia-hunts-western-parts-to-run-its-war-machines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggling to access</a> chips for the Ukraine conflict. </strong></p><p>Russia does have some domestic chipmaking capacity but it's very, very limited, both in terms of the level of advancement — which is not that advanced — but also in terms of capacity. </p><p>What we've learned from the war — which confirms what we presumed before the war — is that, when you take apart the Russian military system, you'll find lots of foreign-produced chips, and often American-produced chips, inside. Many of these chips are off the shelf — things that you can acquire commercially.</p><p>In some ways, the fact that every military in the world is trying to use commercial chips in their systems has been an equalizing factor. But for Russia, it has presented some challenges too. Russia never really knows whether the chips it's buying have been sabotaged in any way. Every country has that to a certain extent. But the U.S., for example, is relying on chip fabs in the U.S. or in friendly countries — whereas Russia is relying almost exclusively on chips produced in unfriendly countries.</p><p>The systems integration capabilities are also lacking in Russia. They've got some, but there's just a lot more expertise in places like the U.S. or in East Asian countries [for] how you bring different types of chips plus software plus the hardware all together in a coherent system. And I think that's also somewhere we've seen Russia face some difficulties.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Photo courtesy of Chris Miller</small></p><p><strong>How successful do you think the Chips Plus Act will be? </strong></p><p>There's a question about getting the most bang for our buck out of the Chips Act fund. I think there are ways we can get more or less lucky on that front. But I don't think there's really a serious argument that the Chips Act funding is not going to increase the amount of leading-edge chipmaking capacity in the U.S. We've already seen a number of new facilities being built on the expectations of those funds.</p><p><strong>Does onshoring chip production increase the chances of conflict between the U.S. and China? It seems the U.S. is onshoring production in anticipation of greater conflict, but is it also possible it increases the chances of something happening by reducing the cost of conflict?</strong></p><p>This sort of mutually assured economic destruction thesis — the idea that the U.S. and China or China and Taiwan could never find themselves in a conflict because it would be too costly to do — I think history provides many examples of times in which economically integrated countries ended up in conflict. So that's one reason to be skeptical of it.</p><p>The second reason is that the assumption that was true for most of the period from Deng Xiaoping forward in China — that Chinese leaders were primarily focused on maximizing GDP — that assumption is no longer valid. The last three years of Chinese policy have not been about maximizing GDP but about political goals and zero COVID. It doesn't mean that they're not going to care at all about economic issues. But we shouldn't assume that either China or the U.S. or Taiwan is approaching these issues solely from the perspective of making sure trading continues unharmed.</p><p>The lesson of 2022 is not that economically integrated powers can't quickly decouple, because we've seen that in a shocking way between Russia and Europe. So I don't think we should take much comfort in the fact that there's a lot of economic integration between China, Taiwan, the U.S., and other countries in the sense that is going to guarantee a peaceful outcome. I don't think history suggests that's true.</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Big Tech’s facade is crumbling https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/sourcecode/hiring-freeze-downturn-big-tech Sun, 02 Oct 2022 10:00:00 +0000

As part of this, we occasionally reprioritize the roles we need to fill and offer similar roles to candidates with pending offers,” the company told Protocol in an emailed statement. </li><li>Privately, sources say the environment has changed noticeably across the company, with a clear focus on cost-cutting. </li><li>And Amazon isn’t alone.

Yes, there were respectable amenities, like big cafeterias and workout centers. But employees weren’t getting massages, napping in pods, or swilling Kombucha on tap. </li><li>Then Silicon Valley came along and changed the paradigm. The can-do, entrepreneurial vibe was matched with enviable perks that helped make a job in tech the decade’s hottest LinkedIn accessory. </li></ul><p><strong>Now, industry leaders are left to grapple with the beast they created. </strong>And it’s somehow a surprise to them that after decades of insane perks, employees are <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/anti-perks-benefits-corporate-culture" target="_self">pushing back</a> on efforts to curtail those benefits. </p><ul><li>“‘We shouldn’t always equate fun with money,” Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/23/google-ceo-pichai-fields-questions-on-cost-cuts-at-all-hands-meeting-.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">now-infamously told employees</a>.

It’s officially spooky season.</em></p><p><em>This week in the startup world: VCs rethink the office, inside the Twitter deal-making, and Cloudflare tries to woo startups.</em></p><h3>VCs rethink where — and what — their office spaces are </h3><br/><p>In the pre-pandemic times, Contrary’s network of venture scouts, founders, and top technologists reflected the magnetic pull Silicon Valley had on the tech industry. About 80% were based in the Bay Area, with a smattering living elsewhere. Today, when Contrary asked where people in its network were living, the split had changed with 40% in the Bay Area and another 40% living in or planning to move to New York.</p><p>It’s totally bifurcated now, said Contrary’s founder Eric Tarczynski. “That was a big wake-up call for us. Before the pandemic, New York wasn’t even really on the road map,” Tarczynski said. “A huge cross-section of engineers are now in New York.”</p><p><strong>Sand Hill Road is losing its shine as more VCs rethink where they’re located. </strong>That’s not to say the Bay Area is over (I’d argue far from it). But cities like New York are still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/09/every-firm-is-talking-about-it-venture-capital-is-having-its-new-york-moment/?sh=5f6b0e487fa3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“having their moment”</a> and continue to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q2-2022-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grow in share of venture deals</a> over the Bay Area. </p><ul><li>In the last year, venture firms like Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, and Lightspeed have added offices in New York City. </li><li>Check-writing partners for Greylock and Threshold VC moved to NYC, while other firms have stealthily set up shop with small teams working out of WeWorks. Even the reporters covering Silicon Valley <a href="https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1574490494918443042" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are moving to NYC</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>There’s another strategy change afoot. </strong>More venture firms are experimenting with building community spaces instead of more offices for their partners to work out of. </p><ul><li>In New York, Tarczynski’s venture firm built Contrary NYC, a space that’s meant to be like <a href="https://www.protocol.com/contrary-nyc-founder-space" target="_self">a Soho House for techies</a> (minus the pool, restaurants, and hotel rooms). It’s supposed to evoke the feel of a club where engineers and entrepreneurs can hang out together, have a space to work, and host events for people in tech. In the last few weeks, there have been female founder dinners, comedy shows, and an appearance by Serena Williams at a launch party for startup Parfait held at Contrary NYC. </li><li>In Los Angeles, Brianne Kimmel’s Worklife fund opened up its new <a href="https://www.worklife.vc/studios/silverlake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worklife Studios</a> space in the Silver Lake neighborhood. She advertises the space as a location where “Discords and DAOs can host events, remote workers can meet new people, and anyone can enjoy our eclectic schedule of gatherings — from dinner parties with the neighborhood to album listening parties with artists.” This past weekend, a thousand people <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1573382493616877569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were waiting in line</a> to get into its space: The band Wallows was doing a pop-up merch store.</li></ul><strong>Part of it is finding a tribe outside of Silicon Valley. </strong>In SF, it can be frustratingly homogenous with many people working in and around the tech industry. In NY and LA, there’s more diversity and with that more opportunity for VCs to step in and be that beacon for the tech communities in a way that’s not as needed in a market like the Bay Area. “For the past 20 or 30 years, SF was the only game in town,” Tarczynski said. “Having a little bit more distribution and even talent flow is frankly pretty good for the venture community.”<h3>Overheard</h3><br/><p><strong>“This makes it seem like I’m desperate. Please stop,” </strong>Elon Musk texted angel investor Jason Calacanis over his promotion of an SPV to buy Twitter shares. Court filings filled with Elon Musk’s texts this week showed the fascinating network of relationships and power brokers that surround Musk in this deal — and <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/musk-texts-power-players" style="" target="_self">the things that they’re angling for</a>. Steve Jurvetson suggested Emil Michael for the job of CEO, but Musk shot it down in favor of someone with actual software experience. Larry Ellison and Reid Hoffman both signed off to invest billions via text. Calacanis had the most interesting relationship with Musk, sending off ideas about charging people, forcing employees back to the office, and even throwing his name in the ring for CEO. Musk asked if he wanted to be an adviser, and Calacanis replied “Board member, advisor, whatever.” “[Y]ou have my sword.” That tone changed later on when Musk appeared miffed at Calacanis after Morgan Stanley and Musk employee Jared Birchall were “very upset” with the way Calacanis was running the deal and that he was taking advantage of his friendship with Musk. “Only ever want to support you,” Calacanis replied <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23112929-elon-musk-text-exhibits-twitter-v-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">in the texts</a>. </p><p><strong></strong><strong>“Some of the business practices don’t rise to the level of ethics that we’re all used to in private equity with your investors and your customers and your community, and that has been a bit disappointing,”</strong> said Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo in a rebuke of the crypto industry. After buying shares in FTX and a handful of other crypto companies, the private equity billionaire <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c5dd6c35-d3e2-4602-a8e4-54266990cfd3?tpcc=nltermsheet" target="_blank">told the FT</a> that he’s backing off investing in the crypto market for now despite remaining long-term bullish on the sector.</p><strong>“When my friend asks if I want to invest, of course I’m going to kick in $10,000 — it’s a way to stay connected, an excuse to get updates,” </strong>an anonymous startup founder <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/silicon-valley-turns-angel-investing-into-a-social-currency" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a>.

Gavin Newsom signed into law a <a href="https://openstates.org/ca/bills/20212022/SB1008/" target="_blank">bill</a> that makes phone calls from California’s prisons free of charge. The new law places the cost of calls not on incarcerated people — or the people receiving calls from them — but on the state’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p><p>California is the second state after Connecticut and the biggest state by far to institute such a law, which is a direct shot at the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-cost-prison-communications-driving-debt-racial-wealth-gap-2021-6" target="_blank">$1.4 billion prison telecom industry</a>. For years prison telecom companies have maintained rates that “can be unjustly and unreasonably high, thereby impeding the ability of inmates and their loved ones to maintain vital connections,” the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-takes-next-big-steps-reducing-inmate-calling-rates" target="_blank">said</a> in 2020. </p><p>Prison reform advocates argue the new California law will have a hugely positive impact on the families of incarcerated people in California — and potentially other states that follow California's lead.  <span></span></p><hr/><p>"From a public policy perspective,  we should be wanting people to stay connected to their social networks, to their families, to be able to start looking for employment if they are close to getting out," said state Sen. Josh Becker, who sponsored the bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1008" target="_blank">SB 1008</a>. "But we have a very perverse system, which inhibits that and actually throws many families into debt."</p><p>For years, the high cost of prison phone calls has sapped money from low-income families with incarcerated loved ones. According to <a href="https://ellabakercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Who-Pays-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">a 2015 report</a> by the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, 34% of families go into debt in their attempt to maintain contact with loved ones inside through phone calls and visitations. The impact is disproportionately felt by women of color, because of the corresponding disproportionate number of men of color in America’s prisons.</p><p>Now, with the governor's blessing, "the simple cost of a call is never going to impair their ability to tell their children they love them or help their partner problem-solve a parenting situation,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a prison reform organization, which was a key player in advocating for the bill.</p><p>The new law covers the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2022/09/Tpop1d220928.pdf" target="_blank">93,000 incarcerated people</a> in the state's prison system, and Becker hopes future legislation will extend free calls into California's city and county jails, as well.</p><p>In addition to making calls free to users, the law prohibits local agencies from “receiving revenue for the provision of communication services to persons in its custody." The law also charges the state’s utility commission with ensuring service does not fall below standard, now that calls are free. Proponents of the law say the policy change will cost California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-09-23/prison-jail-communication-california-senate-bill-1008" target="_blank">about $12 million annually</a>, but that is a small fraction of the <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4517" target="_blank">$14.2 billion budget for the state’s corrections department</a>.</p><p>In recent years, the Federal Communications Commission has tried to clamp down on the astronomical costs charged by prison telecom providers including slashing fees and capping rates at 21 cents per minute for interstate calls in 2013. More recently, the FCC <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-improved-communications-access-incarcerated-people" target="_blank">adopted</a> a rule to prevent prison phone companies from seizing pre-paid funds from users, after one prison telecom giant, GTL, was found to have <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/fcc-gtl" target="_blank">seized</a> $121 million in customer funds. Other local governments have notched their own victories in the fight against sky-high prison call rates. In 2019, New York became the first major city jail system to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/connecticut-free-prison-phone-calls-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">make calls free</a>. In 2020, San Francisco also made phone calls from its jails free and <a href="https://sfgov.org/financialjustice/newsletters/san-francisco-announces-all-phone-calls-county-jails-are-now-free" target="_blank">announced a policy change</a> that would "permanently stop generating revenue from incarcerated people and their families through phone calls."</p><p>But advocates are hopeful that California's law will set an example for other state governments, because of the sheer size of its prison population. “California has a much bigger system,  and what it does matters to the rest of the corrections community,” Tylek said. “It will be a huge trendsetter for everyone else.”</p> Protocol  06bdc570-41d1-4563-9b24-64ff34233b44})Article: %!(EXTRA parse.ArticlesResponse={Great products come from strong patents https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/great-products-are-built-on-strong-patents Fri, 23 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000

</p><p>In today’s knowledge-based economy, IP rights play a foundational role. “Core R&D is the first step in getting good products into people’s hands,” said John Smee, senior VP of engineering and global head of wireless research at Qualcomm.<em> “</em>Everything from smartphones to the Internet of Things, automotive and industrial innovation begins as a breakthrough within our research labs.” At Qualcomm, Smee said, strong IP laws help the company confidently conduct cutting-edge 5G and 6G wireless research that will make its way into products ranging from everyday consumer goods to the factory floor. </p><p>Semiconductor companies, in particular, are fiercely protective of their IP because it’s their primary competitive advantage. Chip companies go to extraordinary lengths to protect their IP by maintaining black boxes only accessible to one person per fab, choosing highly secure operating locations, and keeping R&D teams separate from fab operations teams.</p><p>On the legal side, America’s Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 bestows legal protection of chip topography and design layout IP while the EU’s Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products of 1986 protects IC design. These regulations “have encouraged firms to continue to innovate,” according to the findings of Qualcomm’s and Accenture’s report, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6108671984&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Harnessing the power of the semiconductor value chain</a>.Having a high-quality patent portfolio also helps companies build out their ecosystem, should they choose to license, through advising, training, support for launches, assistance in expanding to new markets, and much more.</p><p>Licensing democratizes innovation and invention— it makes the cutting-edge IP developed by one firm accessible to a broad range of others. As such, it allows other companies to skip the R&D step and jump right into building on the innovator’s foundation. This lowers the barrier to entry for upstart companies while providing a steady return on investments for the companies who have the resources to dedicate to heavy R&D.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p><strong>An outsize economic impact</strong></p><p>IP protection also has an outsized impact on the US economy and helps create good higher-paying jobs. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105345571&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A report from The United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) found that in 2019 industries that intensively use IP protection account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (or about $7.8 trillion) and employ one-third of the total workforce — that’s 47.2 million jobs. In 2019, the average weekly earnings of $1,517 for workers across all IP-intensive industries was 60% higher than weekly earnings for workers in other industries.</p><p>Workers in IP-intensive industries were more likely to earn higher wages as well as participate in employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement plans, the USPTO report found.</p><p> But patent laws are often subject to much debate — one person’s idea of protection is another’s view of monopoly. That’s where organizations like <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6105346519&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LeadershIP</a> come into play. The group brings together experts on IP and innovation to debate issues at the intersection of research, policy, and industry.</p><p>In addition, several efforts are underway to help inventors get their ideas into the marketplace. The Inventors Patent Academy (TIPA), for instance, is an online learning platform aimed at guiding inventors through the benefits of patenting and the process of obtaining a patent. TIPA has designed its program to make patenting more accessible and understandable for groups historically underrepresented in the patent-heavy science and engineering fields, including women, people of color, people who identify as LGBTQIA, lower-income communities, and people with disabilities.</p><p>Closing these gaps would promote U.S. job creation, entrepreneurial activity, economic growth, and global leadership in innovation. Estimates suggest that increasing participation by underrepresented groups in invention and patenting would quadruple the number of American inventors and increase the annual U.S. gross domestic product <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=6106154609&iu=/21901267728" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">by nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>If we want our nation’s rich history of innovation to continue, experts say, we must create an IP protection ecosystem that helps ensure that tech innovation will thrive.</p><p>“With the protection of patents,” Smee said, “there is no limit to where our creativity can take us.”</p>
